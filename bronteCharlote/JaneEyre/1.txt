
"Well, who am I?" he asked.
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand:  he
took it, smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."
Then he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very
careful that I was not disturbed during the night.  Having given
some further directions, and intimates that he should call again
the next day, he departed; to my grief:  I felt so sheltered and
befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow; and as he
closed the door after him, all the room darkened and my heart again
sank:  inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
"Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?"  asked Bessie, rather
softly.
Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might
be rough.  "I will try."
"Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?"
"No, thank you, Bessie."
"Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock;
but you may call me if you want anything in the night."
Wonderful civility this!  It emboldened me to ask a question.
"Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?"
"You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be
better soon, no doubt."
Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near.  I
heard her say -
"Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my
life be alone with that poor child to-night:  she might die; it's
such a strange thing she should have that fit:  I wonder if she
saw anything.  Missis was rather too hard."
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering
together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.  I caught scraps
of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly
to infer the main subject discussed.
"Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished" --
"A great black dog behind him" -- "Three loud raps on the chamber
door" -- "A light in the churchyard just over his grave," &c.  &c.
At last both slept:  the fire and the candle went out.  For me, the
watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained
by dread:  such dread as children only can feel.
No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident
of the red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel
the reverberation to this day.  Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some
fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for
you knew not what you did:  while rending my heart-strings, you
thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities.
Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl
by the nursery hearth.  I felt physically weak and broken down:
but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind:  a
wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had
I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed.  Yet,
I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were
there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama.
Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved
hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed
to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness.  This state
of things should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed
as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging;
but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no
calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with
her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird
of paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had
been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration;
and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my
hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto
been deemed unworthy of such a privilege.  This precious vessel
was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the
circlet of delicate pastry upon it.  Vain favour!  coming, like
most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late!
I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints
of the flowers, seemed strangely faded:  I put both plate and tart
away.  Bessie asked if I would have a book:  the word BOOK acted as
a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver's Travels
from the library.  This book I had again and again perused with
delight.  I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in
it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales:  for
as to the elves, having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves
and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old
wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that
they were all gone out of England to some savage country where
the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population more scant;
whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in my creed, solid parts of
the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might one day, by taking
a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields, houses, and
trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of
the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs,
the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.
Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand -- when
I turned over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures
the charm I had, till now, never failed to find -- all was eerie
and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent
and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread
and dangerous regions.  I closed the book, which I dared no longer
peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.
Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having
washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full
of splendid shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new
bonnet for Georgiana's doll.  Meantime she sang:  her song was -
"In the days when we went gipsying, A long time ago."
I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight;
for Bessie had a sweet voice, -- at least, I thought so.  But
now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an
indescribable sadness.  Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she
sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; "A long time ago" came
out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn.  She passed into
another ballad, this time a really doleful one.
"My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary; Long is the way,
and the mountains are wild; Soon will the twilight close moonless
and dreary Over the path of the poor orphan child.
"Why did they send me so far and so lonely, Up where the moors
spread and grey rocks are piled?  Men are hard-hearted, and kind
angels only Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.
"Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing, Clouds there are
none, and clear stars beam mild, God, in His mercy, protection is
showing, Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
"Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing, Or stray in
the marshes, by false lights beguiled, Still will my Father, with
promise and blessing, Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.
"There is a thought that for strength should avail me, Though both
of shelter and kindred despoiled; Heaven is a home, and a rest will
not fail me; God is a friend to the poor orphan child."
"Come, Miss Jane, don't cry," said Bessie as she finished.  She
might as well have said to the fire, "don't burn!"  but how could
she divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey?  In the
course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.
"What, already up!"  said he, as he entered the nursery.  "Well,
nurse, how is she?"
Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
"Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane:  your
name is Jane, is it not?"
"Yes, sir, Jane Eyre."
"Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what
about?  Have you any pain?"
"No, sir."
"Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with
Missis in the carriage," interposed Bessie.
"Surely not!  why, she is too old for such pettishness."
I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false
charge, I answered promptly, "I never cried for such a thing in
my life:  I hate going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am
miserable."
"Oh fie, Miss!"  said Bessie.
The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled.  I was standing
before him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily:  his eyes were
small and grey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them
shrewd now:  he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking
face.  Having considered me at leisure, he said -
"What made you ill yesterday?"
"She had a fall," said Bessie, again putting in her word.
"Fall!  why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk
at her age?  She must be eight or nine years old."
"I was knocked down," was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me
by another pang of mortified pride; "but that did not make me ill,"
I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang
for the servants' dinner; he knew what it was.  "That's for you,
nurse," said he; "you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture
till you come back."
Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because
punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?"  pursued Mr. Lloyd
when Bessie was gone.
"I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark."
I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.
"Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?"
"Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am:  he died in that room, and was laid out
there.  Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night,
if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without
a candle, -- so cruel that I think I shall never forget it."
"Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid
now in daylight?"
