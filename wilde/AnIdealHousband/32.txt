
LORD GORING.  Ah! I guessed as much!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Looking at him.]  Really!  How?
LORD GORING.  [After some hesitation.]  Oh, merely by something in
the expression of your face as you came in.  Who told her?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley herself.  And the woman I love
knows that I began my career with an act of low dishonesty, that I
built up my life upon sands of shame - that I sold, like a common
huckster, the secret that had been intrusted to me as a man of
honour.  I thank heaven poor Lord Radley died without knowing that I
betrayed him.  I would to God I had died before I had been so
horribly tempted, or had fallen so low.  [Burying his face in his
hands.]
LORD GORING.  [After a pause.]  You have heard nothing from Vienna
yet, in answer to your wire?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Looking up.]  Yes; I got a telegram from the
first secretary at eight o'clock to-night.
LORD GORING.  Well?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Nothing is absolutely known against her.  On
the contrary, she occupies a rather high position in society.  It is
a sort of open secret that Baron Arnheim left her the greater portion
of his immense fortune.  Beyond that I can learn nothing.
LORD GORING.  She doesn't turn out to be a spy, then?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! spies are of no use nowadays.  Their
profession is over.  The newspapers do their work instead.
LORD GORING.  And thunderingly well they do it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, I am parched with thirst.  May I ring
for something?  Some hock and seltzer?
LORD GORING.  Certainly.  Let me.  [Rings the bell.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thanks!  I don't know what to do, Arthur, I
don't know what to do, and you are my only friend.  But what a friend
you are - the one friend I can trust.  I can trust you absolutely,
can't I?
[Enter PHIPPS.]
LORD GORING.  My dear Robert, of course.  Oh!  [To PHIPPS.]  Bring
some hock and seltzer.
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
LORD GORING.  And Phipps!
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
LORD GORING.  Will you excuse me for a moment, Robert?  I want to
give some directions to my servant.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Certainly.
LORD GORING.  When that lady calls, tell her that I am not expected
home this evening.  Tell her that I have been suddenly called out of
town.  You understand?
PHIPPS.  The lady is in that room, my lord.  You told me to show her
into that room, my lord.
LORD GORING.  You did perfectly right.  [Exit PHIPPS.]  What a mess I
am in.  No; I think I shall get through it.  I'll give her a lecture
through the door.  Awkward thing to manage, though.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, tell me what I should do.  My life
seems to have crumbled about me.  I am a ship without a rudder in a
night without a star.
