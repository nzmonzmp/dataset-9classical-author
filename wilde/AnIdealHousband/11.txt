
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I assure you it's all settled.  I don't regret my
tedious journey from Vienna now.  It has been a great success.  But,
of course, for the next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead
secret.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Gently.]  A secret?  Between whom?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [With a flash of amusement in her eyes.]  Between
your husband and myself.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Entering.]  Your carriage is here, Mm
Cheveley!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks!  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Good-night,
Lord Goring!  I am at Claridge's.  Don't you think you might leave a
card?
LORD GORING.  If you wish it, Mrs. Cheveley!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, don't be so solemn about it, or I shall be
obliged to leave a card on you.  In England I suppose that would
hardly be considered EN REGLE.  Abroad, we are more civilised.  Will
you see me down, Sir Robert?  Now that we have both the same
interests at heart we shall be great friends, I hope!
[Sails out on SIR ROBERT CHILTERN'S arm.  LADY CHILTERN goes to the
top of the staircase and looks down at them as they descend.  Her
expression is troubled.  After a little time she is joined by some of
the guests, and passes with them into another reception-room.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  What a horrid woman!
LORD GORING.  You should go to bed, Miss Mabel.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring!
LORD GORING.  My father told me to go to bed an hour ago.  I don't
see why I shouldn't give you the same advice.  I always pass on good
advice.  It is the only thing to do with it.  It is never of any use
to oneself.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, you are always ordering me out of the
room.  I think it most courageous of you.  Especially as I am not
going to bed for hours.  [Goes over to the sofa.]  You can come and
sit down if you like, and talk about anything in the world, except
the Royal Academy, Mrs. Cheveley, or novels in Scotch dialect.  They
are not improving subjects.  [Catches sight of something that is
lying on the sofa half hidden by the cushion.]  What is this?  Some
one has dropped a diamond brooch!  Quite beautiful, isn't it?  [Shows
it to him.]  I wish it was mine, but Gertrude won't let me wear
anything but pearls, and I am thoroughly sick of pearls.  They make
one look so plain, so good and so intellectual.  I wonder whom the
brooch belongs to.
LORD GORING.  I wonder who dropped it.
MABEL CHILTERN.  It is a beautiful brooch.
LORD GORING.  It is a handsome bracelet.
MABEL CHILTERN.  It isn't a bracelet.  It's a brooch.
LORD GORING.  It can be used as a bracelet.  [Takes it from her, and,
pulling out a green letter-case, puts the ornament carefully in it,
and replaces the whole thing in his breast-pocket with the most
perfect sang froid.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  What are you doing?
LORD GORING.  Miss Mabel, I am going to make a rather strange request
to you.
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Eagerly.]  Oh, pray do!  I have been waiting for it
all the evening.
LORD GORING.  [Is a little taken aback, but recovers himself.]  Don't
mention to anybody that I have taken charge of this brooch.  Should
any one write and claim it, let me know at once.
MABEL CHILTERN.  That is a strange request.
LORD GORING.  Well, you see I gave this brooch to somebody once,
years ago.
MABEL CHILTERN.  You did?
