
LORD GORING.  Mrs. Cheveley was concealed in a room adjoining my
library, without my knowledge.  I thought that the person who was
waiting in that room to see me was yourself.  Robert came in
unexpectedly.  A chair or something fell in the room.  He forced his
way in, and he discovered her.  We had a terrible scene.  I still
thought it was you.  He left me in anger.  At the end of everything
Mrs. Cheveley got possession of your letter - she stole it, when or
how, I don't know.
LADY CHILTERN.  At what hour did this happen?
LORD GORING.  At half-past ten.  And now I propose that we tell
Robert the whole thing at once.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Looking at him with amazement that is almost
terror.]  You want me to tell Robert that the woman you expected was
not Mrs. Cheveley, but myself?  That it was I whom you thought was
concealed in a room in your house, at half-past ten o'clock at night?
You want me to tell him that?
LORD GORING.  I think it is better that he should know the exact
truth.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Rising.]  Oh, I couldn't, I couldn't!
LORD GORING.  May I do it?
LADY CHILTERN.  No.
LORD GORING.  [Gravely.]  You are wrong, Lady Chiltern.
LADY CHILTERN.  No.  The letter must be intercepted.  That is all.
But how can I do it?  Letters arrive for him every moment of the day.
His secretaries open them and hand them to him.  I dare not ask the
servants to bring me his letters.  It would be impossible.  Oh! why
don't you tell me what to do?
LORD GORING.  Pray be calm, Lady Chiltern, and answer the questions I
am going to put to you.  You said his secretaries open his letters.
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.
LORD GORING.  Who is with him to-day?  Mr. Trafford, isn't it?
LADY CHILTERN.  No.  Mr. Montford, I think.
LORD GORING.  You can trust him?
LADY CHILTERN.  [With a gesture of despair.]  Oh! how do I know?
LORD GORING.  He would do what you asked him, wouldn't he?
LADY CHILTERN.  I think so.
LORD GORING.  Your letter was on pink paper.  He could recognise it
without reading it, couldn't he?  By the colour?
LADY CHILTERN.  I suppose so.
LORD GORING.  Is he in the house now?
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.
LORD GORING.  Then I will go and see him myself, and tell him that a
certain letter, written on pink paper, is to be forwarded to Robert
to-day, and that at all costs it must not reach him.  [Goes to the
door, and opens it.]  Oh!  Robert is coming upstairs with the letter
in his hand.  It has reached him already.
LADY CHILTERN.  [With a cry of pain.]  Oh! you have saved his life;
what have you done with mine?
[Enter SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  He has the letter in his hand, and is
reading it.  He comes towards his wife, not noticing LORD GORING'S
presence.]
