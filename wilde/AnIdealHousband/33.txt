
LORD GORING.  Robert, you love your wife, don't you?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I love her more than anything in the world.  I
used to think ambition the great thing.  It is not.  Love is the
great thing in the world.  There is nothing but love, and I love her.
But I am defamed in her eyes.  I am ignoble in her eyes.  There is a
wide gulf between us now.  She has found me out, Arthur, she has
found me out.
LORD GORING.  Has she never in her life done some folly - some
indiscretion - that she should not forgive your sin?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My wife!  Never!  She does not know what
weakness or temptation is.  I am of clay like other men.  She stands
apart as good women do - pitiless in her perfection - cold and stern
and without mercy.  But I love her, Arthur.  We are childless, and I
have no one else to love, no one else to love me.  Perhaps if God had
sent us children she might have been kinder to me.  But God has given
us a lonely house.  And she has cut my heart in two.  Don't let us
talk of it.  I was brutal to her this evening.  But I suppose when
sinners talk to saints they are brutal always.  I said to her things
that were hideously true, on my side, from my stand-point, from the
standpoint of men.  But don't let us talk of that
LORD GORING.  Your wife will forgive you.  Perhaps at this moment she
is forgiving you.  She loves you, Robert.  Why should she not
forgive?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  God grant it!  God grant it!  [Buries his face
in his hands.]  But there is something more I have to tell you,
Arthur.
[Enter PHIPPS with drinks.]
PHIPPS.  [Hands hock and seltzer to SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]  Hock and
seltzer, sir.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you.
LORD GORING.  Is your carriage here, Robert?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  No; I walked from the club.
LORD GORING.  Sir Robert will take my cab, Phipps.
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [Exit.]
LORD GORING.  Robert, you don't mind my sending you away?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur, you must let me stay for five minutes.
I have made up my mind what I am going to do to-night in the House.
The debate on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven.  [A chair
falls in the drawing-room.]  What is that?
LORD GORING.  Nothing.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I heard a chair fall in the next room.  Some
one has been listening.
LORD GORING.  No, no; there is no one there.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  There is some one.  There are lights in the
room, and the door is ajar.  Some one has been listening to every
secret of my life.  Arthur, what does this mean?
LORD GORING.  Robert, you are excited, unnerved.  I tell you there is
no one in that room. Sit down, Robert.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Do you give me your word that there is no one
there?
LORD GORING.  Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Your word of honour?  [Sits down.]
LORD GORING.  Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Rises.]  Arthur, let me see for myself.
