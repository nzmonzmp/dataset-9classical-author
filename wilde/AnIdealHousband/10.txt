
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Even you are not rich enough, Sir Robert, to buy back
your past.  No man is.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will not do what you ask me.  I will not.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  You have to.  If you don't . . . [Rises from the
sofa.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Bewildered and unnerved.]  Wait a moment!
What did you propose?  You said that you would give me back my
letter, didn't you?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  That is agreed.  I will be in the Ladies'
Gallery to-morrow night at half-past eleven.  If by that time - and
you will have had heaps of opportunity - you have made an
announcement to the House in the terms I wish, I shall hand you back
your letter with the prettiest thanks, and the best, or at any rate
the most suitable, compliment I can think of.  I intend to play quite
fairly with you.  One should always play fairly . . . when one has
the winning cards.  The Baron taught me that . . . amongst other
things.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You must let me have time to consider your
proposal.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  No; you must settle now!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Give me a week - three days!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Impossible!  I have got to telegraph to Vienna to-
night.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My God! what brought you into my life?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Circumstances.  [Moves towards the door.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Don't go.  I consent.  The report shall be
withdrawn.  I will arrange for a question to be put to me on the
subject.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you.  I knew we should come to an amicable
agreement.  I understood your nature from the first.  I analysed you,
though you did not adore me.  And now you can get my carriage for me,
Sir Robert.  I see the people coming up from supper, and Englishmen
always get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.
[Exit SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]
[Enter Guests, LADY CHILTERN, LADY MARKBY, LORD CAVERSHAM, LADY
BASILDON, MRS. MARCHMONT, VICOMTE DE NANJAC, MR. MONTFORD.]
LADY MARKBY.  Well, dear Mrs. Cheveley, I hope you have enjoyed
yourself.  Sir Robert is very entertaining, is he not?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Most entertaining!  I have enjoyed my talk with him
immensely.
LADY MARKBY.  He has had a very interesting and brilliant career.
And he has married a most admirable wife.  Lady Chiltern is a woman
of the very highest principles, I am glad to say.  I am a little too
old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good example, but I
always admire people who do.  And Lady Chiltern has a very ennobling
effect on life, though her dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.
But one can't have everything, can one?  And now I must go, dear.
Shall I call for you to-morrow?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.
LADY MARKBY.  We might drive in the Park at five.  Everything looks
so fresh in the Park now!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Except the people!
LADY MARKBY.  Perhaps the people are a little jaded.  I have often
observed that the Season as it goes on produces a kind of softening
of the brain.  However, I think anything is better than high
intellectual pressure.  That is the most unbecoming thing there is.
It makes the noses of the young girls so particularly large.  And
there is nothing so difficult to marry as a large nose; men don't
like them.  Good-night, dear!  [To LADY CHILTERN.]  Good-night,
Gertrude!  [Goes out on LORD CAVERSHAM'S arm.]
MRS. CHEVELEY.  What a charming house you have, Lady Chiltern!  I
have spent a delightful evening.  It has been so interesting getting
to know your husband.
LADY CHILTERN.  Why did you wish to meet my husband, Mrs. Cheveley?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I will tell you.  I wanted to interest him in
this Argentine Canal scheme, of which I dare say you have heard.  And
I found him most susceptible, - susceptible to reason, I mean.  A
rare thing in a man.  I converted him in ten minutes.  He is going to
make a speech in the House to-morrow night in favour of the idea.  We
must go to the Ladies' Gallery and hear him!  It will be a great
occasion!
LADY CHILTERN.  There must be some mistake.  That scheme could never
have my husband's support.
