
LADY CHILTERN [Rising.]  Oh, I hope Mrs. Cheveley will stay here a
little.  I should like to have a few minutes' conversation with her.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  How very kind of you, Lady Chiltern!  Believe me,
nothing would give me greater pleasure.
LADY MARKBY.  Ah! no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences
of your schooldays to talk over together.  Good-bye, dear Gertrude!
Shall I see you at Lady Bonar's to-night?  She has discovered a
wonderful new genius.  He does . . . nothing at all, I believe.  That
is a great comfort, is it not?
LADY CHILTERN.  Robert and I are dining at home by ourselves to-
night, and I don't think I shall go anywhere afterwards.  Robert, of
course, will have to be in the House.  But there is nothing
interesting on.
LADY MARKBY.  Dining at home by yourselves?  Is that quite prudent?
Ah, I forgot, your husband is an exception.  Mine is the general
rule, and nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the
general rule.  [Exit LADY MARKBY.]
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Wonderful woman, Lady Markby, isn't she?  Talks more
and says less than anybody I ever met.  She is made to be a public
speaker.  Much more so than her husband, though he is a typical
Englishman, always dull and usually violent.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Makes no answer, but remains standing.  There is a
pause.  Then the eyes of the two women meet.  LADY CHILTERN looks
stern and pale.  MRS. CHEVELEY seem rather amused.]  Mrs. Cheveley, I
think it is right to tell you quite frankly that, had I known who you
really were, I should not have invited you to my house last night.
MRS. CHEVELEY [With an impertinent smile.]  Really?
LADY CHILTERN.  I could not have done so.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I see that after all these years you have not changed
a bit, Gertrude.
LADY CHILTERN.  I never change.
MRS. CHEVELEY [Elevating her eyebrows.]  Then life has taught you
nothing?
LADY CHILTERN.  It has taught me that a person who has once been
guilty of a dishonest and dishonourable action may be guilty of it a
second time, and should be shunned.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Would you apply that rule to every one?
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes, to every one, without exception.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Then I am sorry for you, Gertrude, very sorry for
you.
LADY CHILTERN.  You see now, I was sure, that for many reasons any
further acquaintance between us during your stay in London is quite
impossible?
MRS. CHEVELEY [Leaning back in her chair.]  Do you know, Gertrude, I
don't mind your talking morality a bit.  Morality is simply the
attitude we adopt towards people whom we personally dislike.  You
dislike me.  I am quite aware of that.  And I have always detested
you.  And yet I have come here to do you a service.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Contemptuously.]  Like the service you wished to
render my husband last night, I suppose.  Thank heaven, I saved him
from that.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [Starting to her feet.]  It was you who made him
write that insolent letter to me?  It was you who made him break his
promise?
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Then you must make him keep it.  I give you till to-
morrow morning - no more.  If by that time your husband does not
solemnly bind himself to help me in this great scheme in which I am
interested -
LADY CHILTERN.  This fraudulent speculation -
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Call it what you choose.  I hold your husband in the
hollow of my hand, and if you are wise you will make him do what I
tell him.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Rising and going towards her.]  You are impertinent.
What has my husband to do with you?  With a woman like you?
