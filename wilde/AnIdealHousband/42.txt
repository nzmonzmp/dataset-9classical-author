
MABEL CHILTERN.  [To LORD CAVERSHAM.]  I hope an operation will not
be necessary.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [Smiling at her pertness.]  If it is, we shall have
to give Lady Caversham a narcotic.  Otherwise she would never consent
to have a feather touched.
LORD GORING.  [With increased emphasis.]  Good morning, Miss Mabel!
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Turning round with feigned surprise.]  Oh, are you
here?  Of course you understand that after your breaking your
appointment I am never going to speak to you again.
LORD GORING.  Oh, please don't say such a thing.  You are the one
person in London I really like to have to listen to me.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Lord Goring, I never believe a single word that
either you or I say to each other.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  You are quite right, my dear, quite right . . . as
far as he is concerned, I mean.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Do you think you could possibly make your son behave
a little better occasionally?  Just as a change.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  I regret to say, Miss Chiltern, that I have no
influence at all over my son.  I wish I had.  If I had, I know what I
would make him do.
MABEL CHILTERN.  I am afraid that he has one of those terribly weak
natures that are not susceptible to influence.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  He is very heartless, very heartless.
LORD GORING.  It seems to me that I am a little in the way here.
MABEL CHILTERN.  It is very good for you to be in the way, and to
know what people say of you behind your back.
LORD GORING.  I don't at all like knowing what people say of me
behind my back.  It makes me far too conceited.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  After that, my dear, I really must bid you good
morning.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh!  I hope you are not going to leave me all alone
with Lord Goring?  Especially at such an early hour in the day.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  I am afraid I can't take him with me to Downing
Street.  It is not the Prime Minster's day for seeing the unemployed.
[Shakes hands with MABEL CHILTERN, takes up his hat and stick, and
goes out, with a parting glare of indignation at LORD GORING.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Takes up roses and begins to arrange them in a bowl
on the table.]  People who don't keep their appointments in the Park
are horrid.
LORD GORING.  Detestable.
MABEL CHILTERN.  I am glad you admit it.  But I wish you wouldn't
look so pleased about it.
LORD GORING.  I can't help it.  I always look pleased when I am with
you.
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Sadly.]  Then I suppose it is my duty to remain
with you?
LORD GORING.  Of course it is.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, my duty is a thing I never do, on principle.
It always depresses me.  So I am afraid I must leave you.
