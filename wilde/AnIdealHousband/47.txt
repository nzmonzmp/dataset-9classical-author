
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Sadly.]  And your ambition for me?  You used
to be ambitious for me.
LADY CHILTERN.  Oh, my ambition!  I have none now, but that we two
may love each other.  It was your ambition that led you astray.  Let
us not talk about ambition.
[LORD GORING returns from the conservatory, looking very pleased with
himself, and with an entirely new buttonhole that some one has made
for him.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Going towards him.]  Arthur, I have to thank
you for what you have done for me.  I don't know how I can repay you.
[Shakes hands with him.]
LORD GORING.  My dear fellow, I'll tell you at once.  At the present
moment, under the usual palm tree . . . I mean in the conservatory .
. .
[Enter MASON.]
MASON.  Lord Caversham.
LORD GORING.  That admirable father of mine really makes a habit of
turning up at the wrong moment.  It is very heartless of him, very
heartless indeed.
[Enter LORD CAVERSHAM.  MASON goes out.]
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Good morning, Lady Chiltern!  Warmest
congratulations to you, Chiltern, on your brilliant speech last
night.  I have just left the Prime Minister, and you are to have the
vacant seat in the Cabinet.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [With a look of joy and triumph.]  A seat in
the Cabinet?
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Yes; here is the Prime Minister's letter.  [Hands
letter.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Takes letter and reads it.]  A seat in the
Cabinet!
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Certainly, and you well deserve it too.  You have
got what we want so much in political life nowadays - high character,
high moral tone, high principles.  [To LORD GORING.]  Everything that
you have not got, sir, and never will have.
LORD GORING.  I don't like principles, father.  I prefer prejudices.
[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN is on the brink of accepting the Prime
Minister's offer, when he sees wife looking at him with her clear,
candid eyes.  He then realises that it is impossible.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I cannot accept this offer, Lord Caversham.  I
have made up my mind to decline it.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Decline it, sir!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My intention is to retire at once from public
life.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [Angrily.]  Decline a seat in the Cabinet, and
retire from public life?  Never heard such damned nonsense in the
whole course of my existence.  I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern.
Chiltern, I beg your pardon.  [To LORD GORING.]  Don't grin like
that, sir.
LORD GORING.  No, father.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Lady Chiltern, you are a sensible woman, the most
sensible woman in London, the most sensible woman I know.  Will you
kindly prevent your husband from making such a . . . from taking such
. . . Will you kindly do that, Lady Chiltern?
LADY CHILTERN.  I think my husband in right in his determination,
Lord Caversham.  I approve of it.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  You approve of it?  Good heavens!
LADY CHILTERN.  [Taking her husband's hand.]  I admire him for it.  I
admire him immensely for it.  I have never admired him so much
before.  He is finer than even I thought him.  [To SIR ROBERT
CHILTERN.]  You will go and write your letter to the Prime Minister
now, won't you?  Don't hesitate about it, Robert.
