
LADY CHILTERN.  But you told me yesterday that you had received the
report from the Commission, and that it entirely condemned the whole
thing.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Walking up and down.]  I have reasons now to
believe that the Commission was prejudiced, or, at any rate,
misinformed.  Besides, Gertrude, public and private life are
different things.  They have different laws, and move on different
lines.
LADY CHILTERN.  They should both represent man at his highest.  I see
no difference between them.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Stopping.]  In the present case, on a matter
of practical politics, I have changed my mind.  That is all.
LADY CHILTERN.  All!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Sternly.]  Yes!
LADY CHILTERN.  Robert!  Oh! it is horrible that I should have to ask
you such a question - Robert, are you telling me the whole truth?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Why do you ask me such a question?
LADY CHILTERN.  [After a pause.]  Why do you not answer it?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Sitting down.]  Gertrude, truth is a very
complex thing, and politics is a very complex business.  There are
wheels within wheels.  One may be under certain obligations to people
that one must pay.  Sooner or later in political life one has to
compromise.  Every one does.
LADY CHILTERN.  Compromise?  Robert, why do you talk so differently
to-night from the way I have always heard you talk?  Why are you
changed?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am not changed.  But circumstances alter
things.
LADY CHILTERN.  Circumstances should never alter principles!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But if I told you -
LADY CHILTERN.  What?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That it was necessary, vitally necessary?
LADY CHILTERN.  It can never be necessary to do what is not
honourable.  Or if it be necessary, then what is it that I have
loved!  But it is not, Robert; tell me it is not.  Why should it be?
What gain would you get ?  Money?  We have no need of that!  And
money that comes from a tainted source is a degradation.  Power?  But
power is nothing in itself.  It is power to do good that is fine -
that, and that only.  What is it, then?  Robert, tell me why you are
going to do this dishonourable thing!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, you have no right to use that word.
I told you it was a question of rational compromise.  It is no more
than that.
LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, that is all very well for other men, for men
who treat life simply as a sordid speculation; but not for you,
Robert, not for you.  You are different.  All your life you have
stood apart from others.  You have never let the world soil you.  To
the world, as to myself, you have been an ideal always.  Oh! be that
ideal still.  That great inheritance throw not away - that tower of
ivory do not destroy.  Robert, men can love what is beneath them -
things unworthy, stained, dishonoured.  We women worship when we
love; and when we lose our worship, we lose everything.  Oh! don't
kill my love for you, don't kill that!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude!
LADY CHILTERN.  I know that there are men with horrible secrets in
their lives - men who have done some shameful thing, and who in some
critical moment have to pay for it, by doing some other act of shame
- oh! don't tell me you are such as they are!  Robert, is there in
your life any secret dishonour or disgrace?  Tell me, tell me at
once, that -
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That what?
LADY CHILTERN.  [Speaking very slowly.]  That our lives may drift
apart.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Drift apart?
LADY CHILTERN.  That they may be entirely separate.  It would be
better for us both.
