
LORD GORING.  [Settling his buttonhole.]  Oh, I should fancy Mrs.
Cheveley is one of those very modern women of our time who find a new
scandal as becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the Park
every afternoon at five-thirty.  I am sure she adores scandals, and
that the sorrow of her life at present is that she can't manage to
have enough of them.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Writing.]  Why do you say that?
LORD GORING.  [Turning round.]  Well, she wore far too much rouge
last night, and not quite enough clothes.  That is always a sign of
despair in a woman.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Striking a bell.]  But it is worth while my
wiring to Vienna, is it not?
LORD GORING.  It is always worth while asking a question, though it
is not always worth while answering one.
[Enter MASON.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Is Mr. Trafford in his room?
MASON.  Yes, Sir Robert.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Puts what he has written into an envelope,
which he then carefully closes.]  Tell him to have this sent off in
cipher at once.  There must not be a moment's delay.
MASON.  Yes, Sir Robert.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! just give that back to me again.
[Writes something on the envelope.  MASON then goes out with the
letter.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  She must have had some curious hold over Baron
Arnheim.  I wonder what it was.
LORD GORING.  [Smiling.]  I wonder.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I will fight her to the death, as long as my
wife knows nothing.
LORD GORING.  [Strongly.]  Oh, fight in any case - in any case.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [With a gesture of despair.]  If my wife found
out, there would be little left to fight for.  Well, as soon as I
hear from Vienna, I shall let you know the result.  It is a chance,
just a chance, but I believe in it.  And as I fought the age with its
own weapons, I will fight her with her weapons.  It is only fair, and
she looks like a woman with a past, doesn't she?
LORD GORING.  Most pretty women do.  But there is a fashion in pasts
just as there is a fashion in frocks.  Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley's past
is merely a slightly DECOLLETE one, and they are excessively popular
nowadays.  Besides, my dear Robert, I should not build too high hopes
on frightening Mrs. Cheveley.  I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a
woman who would be easily frightened.  She has survived all her
creditors, and she shows wonderful presence of mind.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh! I live on hopes now.  I clutch at every
chance.  I feel like a man on a ship that is sinking.  The water is
round my feet, and the very air is bitter with storm.  Hush!  I hear
my wife's voice.
[Enter LADY CHILTERN in walking dress.]
LADY CHILTERN.  Good afternoon, Lord Goring!
LORD GORING.  Good afternoon, Lady Chiltern!  Have you been in the
Park?
LADY CHILTERN.  No; I have just come from the Woman's Liberal
Association, where, by the way, Robert, your name was received with
loud applause, and now I have come in to have my tea.  [To LORD
GORING.]  You will wait and have some tea, won't you?
LORD GORING.  I'll wait for a short time, thanks.
LADY CHILTERN.  I will be back in a moment.  I am only going to take
my hat off.
