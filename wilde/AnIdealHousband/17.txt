
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I don't say that I suffered any remorse.  I
didn't.  Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.
But I have paid conscience money many times.  I had a wild hope that
I might disarm destiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have
distributed twice over in public charities since then.
LORD GORING.  [Looking up.]  In public charities?  Dear me! what a
lot of harm you must have done, Robert!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Oh, don't say that, Arthur; don't talk like
that!
LORD GORING.  Never mind what I say, Robert!  I am always saying what
I shouldn't say.  In fact, I usually say what I really think.  A
great mistake nowadays.  It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.
As regards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I
can.  Of course you know that.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you, Arthur, thank you.  But what is to
be done?  What can be done?
LORD GORING.  [Leaning back with his hands in his pockets.]  Well,
the English can't stand a man who is always saying he is in the
right, but they are very fond of a man who admits that he has been in
the wrong.  It is one of the best things in them.  However, in your
case, Robert, a confession would not do.  The money, if you will
allow me to say so, is . . . awkward.  Besides, if you did make a
clean breast of the whole affair, you would never be able to talk
morality again.  And in England a man who can't talk morality twice a
week to a large, popular, immoral audience is quite over as a serious
politician.  There would be nothing left for him as a profession
except Botany or the Church.  A confession would be of no use.  It
would ruin you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It would ruin me.  Arthur, the only thing for
me to do now is to fight the thing out.
LORD GORING.  [Rising from his chair.]  I was waiting for you to say
that, Robert.  It is the only thing to do now.  And you must begin by
telling your wife the whole story.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That I will not do.
LORD GORING.  Robert, believe me, you are wrong.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I couldn't do it.  It would kill her love for
me.  And now about this woman, this Mrs. Cheveley.  How can I defend
myself against her?  You knew her before, Arthur, apparently.
LORD GORING.  Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Did you know her well?
LORD GORING.  [Arranging his necktie.]  So little that I got engaged
to be married to her once, when I was staying at the Tenbys'.  The
affair lasted for three days . . . nearly.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Why was it broken off?
LORD GORING.  [Airily.]  Oh, I forget.  At least, it makes no matter.
By the way, have you tried her with money?  She used to be
confoundedly fond of money.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I offered her any sum she wanted.  She refused.
LORD GORING.  Then the marvellous gospel of gold breaks down
sometimes.  The rich can't do everything, after all.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Not everything.  I suppose you are right.
Arthur, I feel that public disgrace is in store for me.  I feel
certain of it.  I never knew what terror was before.  I know it now.
It is as if a hand of ice were laid upon one's heart.  It is as if
one's heart were beating itself to death in some empty hollow.
LORD GORING.  [Striking the table.]  Robert, you must fight her.  You
must fight her.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But how?
LORD GORING.  I can't tell you how at present.  I have not the
smallest idea.  But every one has some weak point.  There is some
flaw in each one of us.  [Strolls to the fireplace and looks at
himself in the glass.]  My father tells me that even I have faults.
Perhaps I have.  I don't know.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  In defending myself against Mrs. Cheveley, I
have a right to use any weapon I can find, have I not?
LORD GORING.  [Still looking in the glass.]  In your place I don't
think I should have the smallest scruple in doing so.  She is
thoroughly well able to take care of herself.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Sits down at the table and takes a pen in his
hand.]  Well, I shall send a cipher telegram to the Embassy at
Vienna, to inquire if there is anything known against her.  There may
be some secret scandal she might be afraid of.
