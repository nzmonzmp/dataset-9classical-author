
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Talk in your sleep, sir?  What does that matter?
You are not married.
LORD GORING.  No, father, I am not married.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  That is what I have come to talk to you about,
sir.  You have got to get married, and at once.  Why, when I was your
age, sir, I had been an inconsolable widower for three months, and
was already paying my addresses to your admirable mother.  Damme,
sir, it is your duty to get married.  You can't be always living for
pleasure.  Every man of position is married nowadays.  Bachelors are
not fashionable any more.  They are a damaged lot.  Too much is known
about them.  You must get a wife, sir.  Look where your friend Robert
Chiltern has got to by probity, hard work, and a sensible marriage
with a good woman.  Why don't you imitate him, sir?  Why don't you
take him for your model?
LORD GORING.  I think I shall, father.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would, sir.  Then I should be happy.  At
present I make your mother's life miserable on your account.  You are
heartless, sir, quite heartless
LORD GORING.  I hope not, father.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  And it is high time for you to get married.  You are
thirty-four years of age, sir.
LORD GORING.  Yes, father, but I only admit to thirty-two - thirty-
one and a half when I have a really good buttonhole.  This buttonhole
is not . . . trivial enough.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  I tell you you are thirty-four, sir.  And there is a
draught in your room, besides, which makes your conduct worse.  Why
did you tell me there was no draught, sir?  I feel a draught, sir, I
feel it distinctly.
LORD GORING.  So do I, father.  It is a dreadful draught.  I will
come and see you to-morrow, father.  We can talk over anything you
like.  Let me help you on with your cloak, father.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  No, sir; I have called this evening for a definite
purpose, and I am going to see it through at all costs to my health
or yours.  Put down my cloak, sir.
LORD GORING.  Certainly, father.  But let us go into another room.
[Rings bell.]  There is a dreadful draught here.  [Enter PHIPPS.]
Phipps, is there a good fire in the smoking-room?
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
LORD GORING.  Come in there, father.  Your sneezes are quite
heartrending.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, I suppose I have a right to sneeze when I
choose?
LORD GORING.  [Apologetically.]  Quite so, father.  I was merely
expressing sympathy.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Oh, damn sympathy.  There is a great deal too much
of that sort of thing going on nowadays.
LORD GORING.  I quite agree with you, father.  If there was less
sympathy in the world there would be less trouble in the world.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [Going towards the smoking-room.]  That is a
paradox, sir.  I hate paradoxes.
LORD GORING.  So do I, father.  Everybody one meets is a paradox
nowadays.  It is a great bore.  It makes society so obvious.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [Turning round, and looking at his son beneath his
bushy eyebrows.]  Do you always really understand what you say, sir?
LORD GORING.  [After some hesitation.]  Yes, father, if I listen
attentively.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [Indignantly.]  If you listen attentively! . . .
Conceited young puppy!
[Goes off grumbling into the smoking-room.  PHIPPS enters.]
LORD GORING.  Phipps, there is a lady coming to see me this evening
on particular business.  Show her into the drawing-room when she
arrives.  You understand?
