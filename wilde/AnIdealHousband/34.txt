
LORD GORING.  No, no.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  If there is no one there why should I not look
in that room?  Arthur, you must let me go into that room and satisfy
myself.  Let me know that no eavesdropper has heard my life's secret.
Arthur, you don't realise what I am going through.
LORD GORING.  Robert, this must stop.  I have told you that there is
no one in that room - that is enough.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Rushes to the door of the room.]  It is not
enough.  I insist on going into this room.  You have told me there is
no one there, so what reason can you have for refusing me?
LORD GORING.  For God's sake, don't!  There is some one there.  Some
one whom you must not see.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah, I thought so!
LORD GORING.  I forbid you to enter that room.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Stand back.  My life is at stake.  And I don't
care who is there.  I will know who it is to whom I have told my
secret and my shame.  [Enters room.]
LORD GORING.  Great heavens! his own wife!
[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN comes back, with a look of scorn and anger on
his face.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What explanation have you to give me for the
presence of that woman here?
LORD GORING.  Robert, I swear to you on my honour that that lady is
stainless and guiltless of all offence towards you.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  She is a vile, an infamous thing!
LORD GORING.  Don't say that, Robert!  It was for your sake she came
here.  It was to try and save you she came here.  She loves you and
no one else.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You are mad.  What have I to do with her
intrigues with you?  Let her remain your mistress!  You are well
suited to each other.  She, corrupt and shameful - you, false as a
friend, treacherous as an enemy even -
LORD GORING.  It is not true, Robert.  Before heaven, it is not true.
In her presence and in yours I will explain all.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Let me pass, sir.  You have lied enough upon
your word of honour.
[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN goes out.  LORD GORING rushes to the door of the
drawing-room, when MRS. CHEVELEY comes out, looking radiant and much
amused.]
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [With a mock curtsey]  Good evening, Lord Goring!
LORD GORING.  Mrs. Cheveley!  Great heavens! . . . May I ask what you
were doing in my drawing-room?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Merely listening.  I have a perfect passion for
listening through keyholes.  One always hears such wonderful things
through them.
LORD GORING.  Doesn't that sound rather like tempting Providence?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! surely Providence can resist temptation by this
time.  [Makes a sign to him to take her cloak off, which he does.]
LORD GORING.  I am glad you have called.  I am going to give you some
good advice.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! pray don't.  One should never give a woman
anything that she can't wear in the evening.
