
LORD GORING.  Please don't, Miss Mabel.  I have something very
particular to say to you.
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Rapturously.]  Oh! is it a proposal?
LORD GORING.  [Somewhat taken aback.]  Well, yes, it is - I am bound
to say it is.
MABEL CHILTERN.  [With a sigh of pleasure.]  I am so glad.  That
makes the second to-day.
LORD GORING.  [Indignantly.]  The second to-day?  What conceited ass
has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had
proposed to you?
MABEL CHILTERN.  Tommy Trafford, of course.  It is one of Tommy's
days for proposing.  He always proposes on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
during the Season.
LORD GORING.  You didn't accept him, I hope?
MABEL CHILTERN.  I make it a rule never to accept Tommy.  That is why
he goes on proposing.  Of course, as you didn't turn up this morning,
I very nearly said yes.  It would have been an excellent lesson both
for him and for you if I had.  It would have taught you both better
manners.
LORD GORING.  Oh! bother Tommy Trafford.  Tommy is a silly little
ass.  I love you.
MABEL CHILTERN.  I know.  And I think you might have mentioned it
before.  I am sure I have given you heaps of opportunities.
LORD GORING.  Mabel, do be serious.  Please be serious.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Ah! that is the sort of thing a man always says to a
girl before he has been married to her.  He never says it afterwards.
LORD GORING.  [Taking hold of her hand.]  Mabel, I have told you that
I love you.  Can't you love me a little in return?
MABEL CHILTERN.  You silly Arthur!  If you knew anything about . . .
anything, which you don't, you would know that I adore you.  Every
one in London knows it except you.  It is a public scandal the way I
adore you.  I have been going about for the last six months telling
the whole of society that I adore you.  I wonder you consent to have
anything to say to me.  I have no character left at all.  At least, I
feel so happy that I am quite sure I have no character left at all.
LORD GORING.  [Catches her in his arms and kisses her.  Then there is
a pause of bliss.]  Dear!  Do you know I was awfully afraid of being
refused!
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Looking up at him.]  But you never have been
refused yet by anybody, have you, Arthur?  I can't imagine any one
refusing you.
LORD GORING.  [After kissing her again.]  Of course I'm not nearly
good enough for you, Mabel.
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Nestling close to him.]  I am so glad, darling.  I
was afraid you were.
LORD GORING.  [After some hesitation.]  And I'm . . . I'm a little
over thirty.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Dear, you look weeks younger than that.
LORD GORING.  [Enthusiastically.]  How sweet of you to say so! . . .
And it is only fair to tell you frankly that I am fearfully
extravagant.
MABEL CHILTERN.  But so am I, Arthur.  So we're sure to agree.  And
now I must go and see Gertrude.
LORD GORING.  Must you really?  [Kisses her.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  Yes.
LORD GORING.  Then do tell her I want to talk to her particularly.  I
have been waiting here all the morning to see either her or Robert.
