
MRS. CHEVELEY.  The post should suit him admirably, unless he has
deteriorated since I knew him first.
LADY MARKBY.  [Reflecting.]  You are remarkably modern, Mabel.  A
little too modern, perhaps.  Nothing is so dangerous as being too
modern.  One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  I have
known many instances of it
MABEL CHILTERN.  What a dreadful prospect!
LADY MARKBY.  Ah! my dear, you need not be nervous.  You will always
be as pretty as possible.  That is the best fashion there is, and the
only fashion that England succeeds in setting.
MABEL CHILTERN.  [With a curtsey.]  Thank you so much, Lady Markby,
for England . . . and myself.  [Goes out.]
LADY MARKBY.  [Turning to LADY CHILTERN.]  Dear Gertrude, we just
called to know if Mrs. Cheveley's diamond brooch has been found.
LADY CHILTERN.  Here?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I missed it when I got back to Claridge's, and
I thought I might possibly have dropped it here.
LADY CHILTERN.  I have heard nothing about it.  But I will send for
the butler and ask.  [Touches the bell.]
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, pray don't trouble, Lady Chiltern.  I dare say I
lost it at the Opera, before we came on here.
LADY MARKBY.  Ah yes, I suppose it must have been at the Opera.  The
fact is, we all scramble and jostle so much nowadays that I wonder we
have anything at all left on us at the end of an evening.  I know
myself that, when I am coming back from the Drawing Room, I always
feel as if I hadn't a shred on me, except a small shred of decent
reputation, just enough to prevent the lower classes making painful
observations through the windows of the carriage.  The fact is that
our Society is terribly over-populated.  Really, some one should
arrange a proper scheme of assisted emigration.  It would do a great
deal of good.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I quite agree with you, Lady Markby.  It is nearly
six years since I have been in London for the Season, and I must say
Society has become dreadfully mixed.  One sees the oddest people
everywhere.
LADY MARKBY.  That is quite true, dear.  But one needn't know them.
I'm sure I don't know half the people who come to my house.  Indeed,
from all I hear, I shouldn't like to.
[Enter MASON.]
LADY CHILTERN.  What sort of a brooch was it that you lost, Mrs.
Cheveley?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  A diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a rather large
ruby.
LADY MARKBY.  I thought you said there was a sapphire on the head,
dear?
MRS. CHEVELEY [Smiling.]  No, lady Markby - a ruby.
LADY MARKBY.  [Nodding her head.]  And very becoming, I am quite
sure.
LADY CHILTERN.  Has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of
the rooms this morning, Mason?
MASON.  No, my lady.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  It really is of no consequence, Lady Chiltern.  I am
so sorry to have put you to any inconvenience.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Coldly.]  Oh, it has been no inconvenience.  That
will do, Mason.  You can bring tea.
[Exit MASON.]
LADY MARKBY.  Well, I must say it is most annoying to lose anything.
I remember once at Bath, years ago, losing in the Pump Room an
exceedingly handsome cameo bracelet that Sir John had given me.  I
don't think he has ever given me anything since, I am sorry to say.
He has sadly degenerated.  Really, this horrid House of Commons quite
ruins our husbands for us.  I think the Lower House by far the
greatest blow to a happy married life that there has been since that
terrible thing called the Higher Education of Women was invented.
