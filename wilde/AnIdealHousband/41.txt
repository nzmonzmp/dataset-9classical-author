
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Uphold it, sir?  How little you know him!  Why, he
denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political
finance.  This speech is the turning-point in his career, as THE
TIMES points out.  You should read this article, sir.  [Opens THE
TIMES.]  'Sir Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young
statesmen . . . Brilliant orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-
known integrity of character . . . Represents what is best in English
public life . . . Noble contrast to the lax morality so common among
foreign politicians.'  They will never say that of you, sir.
LORD GORING.  I sincerely hope not, father.  However, I am delighted
at what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted.  It shows he
has got pluck.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.
LORD GORING.  Ah! I prefer pluck.  It is not so common, nowadays, as
genius is.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  I wish you would go into Parliament.
LORD GORING.  My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into
the House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed
there.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Why don't you try to do something useful in life?
LORD GORING.  I am far too young.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [Testily.]  I hate this affectation of youth, sir.
It is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.
LORD GORING.  Youth isn't an affectation.  Youth is an art.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Why don't you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern?
LORD GORING.  I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the
morning.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  I don't suppose there is the smallest chance of her
accepting you.
LORD GORING.  I don't know how the betting stands to-day.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  If she did accept you she would be the prettiest
fool in England.
LORD GORING.  That is just what I should like to marry.  A thoroughly
sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in
less than six months.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  You don't deserve her, sir.
LORD GORING.  My dear father, if we men married the women we
deserved, we should have a very bad time of it.
[Enter MABEL CHILTERN.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh! . . . How do you do, Lord Caversham?  I hope
Lady Caversham is quite well?
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Lady Caversham is as usual, as usual.
LORD GORING.  Good morning, Miss Mabel!
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Taking no notice at all of LORD GORING, and
addressing herself exclusively to LORD CAVERSHAM.]  And Lady
Caversham's bonnets . . . are they at all better?
LORD CAVERSHAM.  They have had a serious relapse, I am sorry to say.
LORD GORING.  Good morning, Miss Mabel!
