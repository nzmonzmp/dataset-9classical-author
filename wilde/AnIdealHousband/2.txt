
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I don't know that women are always rewarded for being
charming.  I think they are usually punished for it!  Certainly, more
women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers
than through anything else!  At least that is the only way I can
account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in
London!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What an appalling philosophy that sounds!  To
attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence.
But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those
seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I'm neither.  Optimism begins in a broad grin,
and Pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  Besides, they are both of
them merely poses.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You prefer to be natural?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  But it is such a very difficult pose to
keep up.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What would those modern psychological
novelists, of whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that
psychology cannot explain us.  Men can be analysed, women . . .
merely adored.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You think science cannot grapple with the
problem of women?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Science can never grapple with the irrational.  That
is why it has no future before it, in this world.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And women represent the irrational.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Well-dressed women do.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [With a polite bow.]  I fear I could hardly
agree with you there.  But do sit down.  And now tell me, what makes
you leave your brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London - or perhaps
the question is indiscreet?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Questions are never indiscreet.  Answers sometimes
are.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics
or pleasure?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Politics are my only pleasure.  You see nowadays it
is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till
one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we
are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  And
philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people
who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures.  I prefer politics.  I
think they are more . . . becoming!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  A political life is a noble career!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir
Robert.  And sometimes it is a great nuisance.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Which do you find it?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I?  A combination of all three.  [Drops her fan.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Picks up fan.]  Allow me!
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But you have not told me yet what makes you
honour London so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! I don't care about the London season!  It is too
matrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from
them.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a
woman's curiosity is.  Almost as great as a man's!  I wanted
immensely to meet you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley.
I find that little things are so very difficult to do.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [After a moment's reflection.]  No, I don't think it
is quite a little thing.
