
LORD GORING.  [With deep feeling in his voice.]  Do not for that
reason set him down now too low.  If he has fallen from his altar, do
not thrust him into the mire.  Failure to Robert would be the very
mire of shame.  Power is his passion.  He would lose everything, even
his power to feel love.  Your husband's life is at this moment in
your hands, your husband's love is in your hands.  Don't mar both for
him.
[Enter SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, here is the draft of my letter.
Shall I read it to you?
LADY CHILTERN.  Let me see it.
[SIR ROBERT hands her the letter.  She reads it, and then, with a
gesture of passion, tears it up.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What are you doing?
LADY CHILTERN.  A man's life is of more value than a woman's.  It has
larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  Our lives revolve in
curves of emotions.  It is upon lines of intellect that a man's life
progresses.  I have just learnt this, and much else with it, from
Lord Goring.  And I will not spoil your life for you, nor see you
spoil it as a sacrifice to me, a useless sacrifice!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude!  Gertrude!
LADY CHILTERN.  You can forget.  Men easily forget.  And I forgive.
That is how women help the world.  I see that now.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Deeply overcome by emotion, embraces her.]  My
wife! my wife!  [To LORD GORING.]  Arthur, it seems that I am always
to be in your debt.
LORD GORING.  Oh dear no, Robert.  Your debt is to Lady Chiltern, not
to me!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I owe you much.  And now tell me what you were
going to ask me just now as Lord Caversham came in.
LORD GORING.  Robert, you are your sister's guardian, and I want your
consent to my marriage with her.  That is all.
LADY CHILTERN.  Oh, I am so glad!  I am so glad!  [Shakes hands with
LORD GORING.]
LORD GORING.  Thank you, Lady Chiltern.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [With a troubled look.]  My sister to be your
wife?
LORD GORING.  Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Speaking with great firmness.]  Arthur, I am
very sorry, but the thing is quite out of the question.  I have to
think of Mabel's future happiness.  And I don't think her happiness
would be safe in your hands.  And I cannot have her sacrificed!
LORD GORING.  Sacrificed!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes, utterly sacrificed.  Loveless marriages
are horrible.  But there is one thing worse than an absolutely
loveless marriage.  A marriage in which there is love, but on one
side only; faith, but on one side only; devotion, but on one side
only, and in which of the two hearts one is sure to be broken.
LORD GORING.  But I love Mabel.  No other woman has any place in my
life.
LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, if they love each other, why should they not
be married?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Arthur cannot bring Mabel the love that she
deserves.
LORD GORING.  What reason have you for saying that?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [After a pause.]  Do you really require me to
tell you?
