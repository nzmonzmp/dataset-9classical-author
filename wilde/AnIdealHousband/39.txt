
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  I can't bear so upright a gentleman, so
honourable an English gentleman, being so shamefully deceived, and so
-
LORD GORING.  Well?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I find that somehow Gertrude Chiltern's dying speech
and confession has strayed into my pocket.
LORD GORING.  What do you mean?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [With a bitter note of triumph in her voice.]  I mean
that I am going to send Robert Chiltern the love-letter his wife
wrote to you to-night.
LORD GORING.  Love-letter?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [Laughing.]  'I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming
to you.  Gertrude.'
[LORD GORING rushes to the bureau and takes up the envelope, finds is
empty, and turns round.]
LORD GORING.  You wretched woman, must you always be thieving?  Give
me back that letter.  I'll take it from you by force.  You shall not
leave my room till I have got it.
[He rushes towards her, but MRS. CHEVELEY at once puts her hand on
the electric bell that is on the table. The bell sounds with shrill
reverberations, and PHIPPS enters.]
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [After a pause.]  Lord Goring merely rang that you
should show me out.  Good-night, Lord Goring!
[Goes out followed by PHIPPS.  Her face it illumined with evil
triumph.  There is joy in her eyes.  Youth seems to have come back to
her.  Her last glance is like a swift arrow.  LORD GORING bites his
lip, and lights his a cigarette.]
ACT DROPS
FOURTH ACT
SCENE
Same as Act II.
[LORD GORING is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
pockets.  He  is looking rather bored.]
LORD GORING.  [Pulls out his watch, inspects it, and rings the bell.]
It is a great nuisance.  I can't find any one in this house to talk
to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
latest edition of something or other.
[Enter servant.]
JAMES.  Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.
LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern not down yet?
