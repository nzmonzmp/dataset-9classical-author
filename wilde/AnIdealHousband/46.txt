
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  'I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.
Gertrude.'  Oh, my love!  Is this true?  Do you indeed trust me, and
want me?  If so, it was for me to come to you, not for you to write
of coming to me.  This letter of yours, Gertrude, makes me feel that
nothing that the world may do can hurt me now.  You want me,
Gertrude?
[LORD GORING, unseen by SIR ROBERT CHILTERN, makes an imploring sign
to LADY CHILTERN to accept the situation and SIR ROBERT'S error.]
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You trust me, Gertrude?
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! why did you not add you loved me?
LADY CHILTERN.  [Taking his hand.]  Because I loved you.
[LORD GORING passes into the conservatory.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Kisses her.]  Gertrude, you don't know what I
feel.  When Montford passed me your letter across the table - he had
opened it by mistake, I suppose, without looking at the handwriting
on the envelope - and I read it - oh! I did not care what disgrace or
punishment was in store for me, I only thought you loved me still.
LADY CHILTERN.  There is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public
shame.  Mrs. Cheveley has handed over to Lord Goring the document
that was in her possession, and he has destroyed it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Are you sure of this, Gertrude?
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes; Lord Goring has just told me.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Then I am safe!  Oh! what a wonderful thing to
be safe!  For two days I have been in terror.  I am safe now.  How
did Arthur destroy my letter?  Tell me.
LADY CHILTERN.  He burned it.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I wish I had seen that one sin of my youth
burning to ashes.  How many men there are in modern life who would
like to see their past burning to white ashes before them!  Is Arthur
still here?
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes; he is in the conservatory.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so glad now I made that speech last night
in the House, so glad.  I made it thinking that public disgrace might
be the result.  But it has not been so.
LADY CHILTERN.  Public honour has been the result.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I think so.  I fear so, almost.  For although I
am safe from detection, although every proof against me is destroyed,
I suppose, Gertrude . . . I suppose I should retire from public life?
[He looks anxiously at his wife.]
LADY CHILTERN.  [Eagerly.]  Oh yes, Robert, you should do that.  It
is your duty to do that.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is much to surrender.
LADY CHILTERN.  No; it will be much to gain.
[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN walks up and down the room with a troubled
expression.  Then comes over to his wife, and puts his hand on her
shoulder.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And you would be happy living somewhere alone
with me, abroad perhaps, or in the country away from London, away
from public life?  You would have no regrets?
LADY CHILTERN.  Oh! none, Robert.
