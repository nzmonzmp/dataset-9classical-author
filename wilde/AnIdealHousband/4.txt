goes out with SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  LORD GORING saunters over to
MABEL CHILTERN.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  You are very late!
LORD GORING.  Have you missed me?
MABEL CHILTERN.  Awfully!
LORD GORING.  Then I am sorry I did not stay away longer.  I like
being missed.
MABEL CHILTERN.  How very selfish of you!
LORD GORING.  I am very selfish.
MABEL CHILTERN.  You are always telling me of your bad qualities,
Lord Goring.
LORD GORING.  I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!
MABEL CHILTERN.  Are the others very bad?
LORD GORING.  Quite dreadful!  When I think of them at night I go to
sleep at once.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I delight in your bad qualities.  I wouldn't
have you part with one of them.
LORD GORING.  How very nice of you!  But then you are always nice.
By the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.  Who brought
Mrs. Cheveley here?  That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out
of the room with your brother?
MABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I think Lady Markby brought her.  Why do you
ask?
LORD GORING.  I haven't seen her for years, that is all.
MABEL CHILTERN.  What an absurd reason!
LORD GORING.  All reasons are absurd.
MABEL CHILTERN.  What sort of a woman is she?
LORD GORING.  Oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!
MABEL CHILTERN.  I dislike her already.
LORD GORING.  That shows your admirable good taste.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  [Approaching.]  Ah, the English young lady is the
dragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good taste.
LORD GORING.  So the newspapers are always telling us.
VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I read all your English newspapers.  I find them
so amusing.
LORD GORING.  Then, my dear Nanjac, you must certainly read between
the lines.
