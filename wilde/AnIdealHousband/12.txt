
LORD GORING.  Yes.
[LADY CHILTERN enters alone.  The other guests have gone.]
MABEL CHILTERN.  Then I shall certainly bid you good-night.  Good-
night, Gertrude!  [Exit.]
LADY CHILTERN.  Good-night, dear!  [To LORD GORING.]  You saw whom
Lady Markby brought here to-night?
LORD GORING.  Yes.  It was an unpleasant surprise.  What did she come
here for?
LADY CHILTERN.  Apparently to try and lure Robert to uphold some
fraudulent scheme in which she is interested.  The Argentine Canal,
in fact.
LORD GORING.  She has mistaken her man, hasn't she?
LADY CHILTERN.  She is incapable of understanding an upright nature
like my husband's!
LORD GORING.  Yes.  I should fancy she came to grief if she tried to
get Robert into her toils.  It is extraordinary what astounding
mistakes clever women make.
LADY CHILTERN.  I don't call women of that kind clever.  I call them
stupid!
LORD GORING.  Same thing often.  Good-night, Lady Chiltern!
LADY CHILTERN.  Good-night!
[Enter SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  My dear Arthur, you are not going?  Do stop a
little!
LORD GORING.  Afraid I can't, thanks.  I have promised to look in at
the Hartlocks'.  I believe they have got a mauve Hungarian band that
plays mauve Hungarian music.  See you soon.  Good-bye!
[Exit]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  How beautiful you look to-night, Gertrude!
LADY CHILTERN.  Robert, it is not true, is it?  You are not going to
lend your support to this Argentine speculation?  You couldn't!
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Starting.]  Who told you I intended to do so?
LADY CHILTERN.  That woman who has just gone out, Mrs. Cheveley, as
she calls herself now.  She seemed to taunt me with it.  Robert, I
know this woman.  You don't.  We were at school together.  She was
untruthful, dishonest, an evil influence on every one whose trust or
friendship she could win.  I hated, I despised her.  She stole
things, she was a thief.  She was sent away for being a thief.  Why
do you let her influence you?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Gertrude, what you tell me may be true, but it
happened many years ago.  It is best forgotten!  Mrs. Cheveley may
have changed since then.  No one should be entirely judged by their
past.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Sadly.]  One's past is what one is.  It is the only
way by which people should be judged.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  That is a hard saying, Gertrude!
LADY CHILTERN.  It is a true saying, Robert.  And what did she mean
by boasting that she had got you to lend your support, your name, to
a thing I have heard you describe as the most dishonest and
fraudulent scheme there has ever been in political life?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Biting his lip.]  I was mistaken in the view I
took.  We all may make mistakes.
