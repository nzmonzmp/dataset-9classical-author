
MABEL CHILTERN.  Do you mean to say you didn't come here expressly to
propose to me?
LORD GORING.  [Triumphantly.]  No; that was a flash of genius.
MABEL CHILTERN.  Your first.
LORD GORING.  [With determination.]  My last.
MABEL CHILTERN.  I am delighted to hear it.  Now don't stir.  I'll be
back in five minutes.  And don't fall into any temptations while I am
away.
LORD GORING.  Dear Mabel, while you are away, there are none.  It
makes me horribly dependent on you.
[Enter LADY CHILTERN.]
LADY CHILTERN.  Good morning, dear!  How pretty you are looking!
MABEL CHILTERN.  How pale you are looking, Gertrude!  It is most
becoming!
LADY CHILTERN.  Good morning, Lord Goring!
LORD GORING.  [Bowing.]  Good morning, Lady Chiltern!
MABEL CHILTERN.  [Aside to LORD GORING.]  I shall be in the
conservatory under the second palm tree on the left.
LORD GORING.  Second on the left?
MABEL CHILTERN.  [With a look of mock surprise.]  Yes; the usual palm
tree.
[Blows a kiss to him, unobserved by LADY CHILTERN, and goes out.]
LORD GORING.  Lady Chiltern, I have a certain amount of very good
news to tell you.  Mrs. Cheveley gave me up Robert's letter last
night, and I burned it.  Robert is safe.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Sinking on the sofa.]  Safe!  Oh!  I am so glad of
that.  What a good friend you are to him - to us!
LORD GORING.  There is only one person now that could be said to be
in any danger.
LADY CHILTERN.  Who is that?
LORD GORING.  [Sitting down beside her.]  Yourself.
LADY CHILTERN.  I?  In danger?  What do you mean?
LORD GORING.  Danger is too great a word.  It is a word I should not
have used.  But I admit I have something to tell you that may
distress you, that terribly distresses me.  Yesterday evening you
wrote me a very beautiful, womanly letter, asking me for my help.
You wrote to me as one of your oldest friends, one of your husband's
oldest friends.  Mrs. Cheveley stole that letter from my rooms.
LADY CHILTERN.  Well, what use is it to her?  Why should she not have
it?
LORD GORING.  [Rising.]  Lady Chiltern, I will be quite frank with
you.  Mrs. Cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and
proposes to send it to your husband.
LADY CHILTERN.  But what construction could she put on it? . . . Oh!
not that! not that!  If I in - in trouble, and wanting your help,
trusting you, propose to come to you . . . that you may advise me . .
. assist me . . . Oh! are there women so horrible as that . . .?  And
she proposes to send it to my husband?  Tell me what happened.  Tell
me all that happened.
