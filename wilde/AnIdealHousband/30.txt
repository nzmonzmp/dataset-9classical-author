
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
LORD GORING.  It is a matter of the gravest importance, Phipps.
PHIPPS.  I understand, my lord.
LORD GORING.  No one else is to be admitted, under any circumstances.
PHIPPS.  I understand, my lord.  [Bell rings.]
LORD GORING.  Ah! that is probably the lady.  I shall see her myself.
[Just as he is going towards the door LORD CAVERSHAM enters from the
smoking-room.]
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir? am I to wait attendance on you?
LORD GORING.  [Considerably perplexed.]  In a moment, father.  Do
excuse me.  [LORD CAVERSHAM goes back.]  Well, remember my
instructions, Phipps - into that room.
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.
[LORD GORING goes into the smoking-room.  HAROLD, the footman shows
MRS.  CHEVELEY in.  Lamia-like, she is in green and silver.  She has
a cloak of black satin, lined with dead rose-leaf silk.]
HAROLD.  What name, madam?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [To PHIPPS, who advances towards her.]  Is Lord
Goring not here?  I was told he was at home?
PHIPPS.  His lordship is engaged at present with Lord Caversham,
madam.
[Turns a cold, glassy eye on HAROLD, who at once retires.]
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [To herself.]  How very filial!
PHIPPS.  His lordship told me to ask you, madam, to be kind enough to
wait in the drawing-room for him.  His lordship will come to you
there.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [With a look of surprise.]  Lord Goring expects me?
PHIPPS.  Yes, madam.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Are you quite sure?
PHIPPS.  His lordship told me that if a lady called I was to ask her
to wait in the drawing-room.  [Goes to the door of the drawing-room
and opens it.]  His lordship's directions on the subject were very
precise.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [To herself]  How thoughtful of him!  To expect the
unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.  [Goes towards the
drawing-room and looks in.]  Ugh!  How dreary a bachelor's drawing-
room always looks.  I shall have to alter all this.  [PHIPPS brings
the lamp from the writing-table.]  No, I don't care for that lamp.
It is far too glaring.  Light some candles.
PHIPPS.  [Replaces lamp.]  Certainly, madam.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I hope the candles have very becoming shades.
PHIPPS.  We have had no complaints about them, madam, as yet.
