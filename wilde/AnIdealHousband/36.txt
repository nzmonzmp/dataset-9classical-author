
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I loved you, Arthur.
LORD GORING.  My dear Mrs. Cheveley, you have always been far too
clever to know anything about love.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I did love you.  And you loved me.  You know you
loved me; and love is a very wonderful thing.  I suppose that when a
man has once loved a woman, he will do anything for her, except
continue to love her?  [Puts her hand on his.]
LORD GORING.  [Taking his hand away quietly.]  Yes:  except that.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [After a pause.]  I am tired of living abroad.  I
want to come back to London.  I want to have a charming house here.
I want to have a salon.  If one could only teach the English how to
talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite
civilised.  Besides, I have arrived at the romantic stage.  When I
saw you last night at the Chilterns', I knew you were the only person
I had ever cared for, if I ever have cared for anybody, Arthur.  And
so, on the morning of the day you marry me, I will give you Robert
Chiltern's letter.  That is my offer.  I will give it to you now, if
you promise to marry me.
LORD GORING.  Now?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [Smiling.]  To-morrow.
LORD GORING.  Are you really serious?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes, quite serious.
LORD GORING.  I should make you a very bad husband.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I don't mind bad husbands.  I have had two.  They
amused me immensely.
LORD GORING.  You mean that you amused yourself immensely, don't you?
MRS. CHEVELEY.  What do you know about my married life?
LORD GORING.  Nothing:  but I can read it like a book.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  What book?
LORD GORING.  [Rising.]  The Book of Numbers.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  Do you think it is quite charming of you to be so
rude to a woman in your own house?
LORD GORING.  In the case of very fascinating women, sex is a
challenge, not a defence.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  I suppose that is meant for a compliment.  My dear
Arthur, women are never disarmed by compliments.  Men always are.
That is the difference between the two sexes.
LORD GORING.  Women are never disarmed by anything, as far as I know
them.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  [After a pause.]  Then you are going to allow your
greatest friend, Robert Chiltern, to be ruined, rather than marry
some one who really has considerable attractions left.  I thought you
would have risen to some great height of self-sacrifice, Arthur.  I
think you should.  And the rest of your life you could spend in
contemplating your own perfections.
LORD GORING.  Oh! I do that as it is.  And self-sacrifice is a thing
that should be put down by law.  It is so demoralising to the people
for whom one sacrifices oneself.  They always go to the bad.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  As if anything could demoralise Robert Chiltern!  You
seem to forget that I know his real character.
LORD GORING.  What you know about him is not his real character.  It
was an act of folly done in his youth, dishonourable, I admit,
shameful, I admit, unworthy of him, I admit, and therefore . . . not
his true character.
MRS. CHEVELEY.  How you men stand up for each other!
