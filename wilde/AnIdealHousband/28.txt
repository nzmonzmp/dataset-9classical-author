
PHIPPS.  Three, my lord.  [Hands letters on a salver.]
LORD GORING.  [Takes letters.]  Want my cab round in twenty minutes.
PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [Goes towards door.]
LORD GORING.  [Holds up letter in pink envelope.]  Ahem!  Phipps,
when did this letter arrive?
PHIPPS.  It was brought by hand just after your lordship went to the
club.
LORD GORING.  That will do.  [Exit PHIPPS.]  Lady Chiltern's
handwriting on Lady Chiltern's pink notepaper.  That is rather
curious.  I thought Robert was to write.  Wonder what Lady Chiltern
has got to say to me?  [Sits at bureau and opens letter, and reads
it.]  'I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.'
[Puts down the letter with a puzzled look.  Then takes it up, and
reads it again slowly.]  'I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to
you.'  So she has found out everything!  Poor woman!  Poor woman!  [
Pulls out watch and looks at it.]  But what an hour to call!  Ten
o'clock!  I shall have to give up going to the Berkshires.  However,
it is always nice to be expected, and not to arrive.  I am not
expected at the Bachelors', so I shall certainly go there.  Well, I
will make her stand by her husband.  That is the only thing for her
to do.  That is the only thing for any woman to do.  It is the growth
of the moral sense in women that makes marriage such a hopeless, one-
sided institution.  Ten o'clock.  She should be here soon.  I must
tell Phipps I am not in to any one else.  [Goes towards bell]
[Enter PHIPPS.]
PHIPPS.  Lord Caversham.
LORD GORING.  Oh, why will parents always appear at the wrong time?
Some extraordinary mistake in nature, I suppose.  [Enter LORD
CAVERSHAM.]  Delighted to see you, my dear father.  [Goes to meet
him.]
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Take my cloak off.
LORD GORING.  Is it worth while, father?
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Of course it is worth while, sir.  Which is the most
comfortable chair?
LORD GORING.  This one, father.  It is the chair I use myself, when I
have visitors.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Thank ye.  No draught, I hope, in this room?
LORD GORING.  No, father.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [Sitting down.]  Glad to hear it.  Can't stand
draughts.  No draughts at home.
LORD GORING.  Good many breezes, father.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Eh?  Eh?  Don't understand what you mean.  Want to
have a serious conversation with you, sir.
LORD GORING.  My dear father!  At this hour?
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, it is only ten o'clock.  What is your
objection to the hour?  I think the hour is an admirable hour!
LORD GORING.  Well, the fact is, father, this is not my day for
talking seriously.  I am very sorry, but it is not my day.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  What do you mean, sir?
LORD GORING.  During the Season, father, I only talk seriously on the
first Tuesday in every month, from four to seven.
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, make it Tuesday, sir, make it Tuesday.
LORD GORING.  But it is after seven, father, and my doctor says I
must not have any serious conversation after seven.  It makes me talk
in my sleep.
