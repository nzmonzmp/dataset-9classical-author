
LORD GORING.  [In his most earnest manner.]  Oh! please don't.  It is
so pretty.  One of the prettiest hats I ever saw.  I hope the Woman's
Liberal Association received it with loud applause.
LADY CHILTERN.  [With a smile.]  We have much more important work to
do than look at each other's bonnets, Lord Goring.
LORD GORING.  Really?  What sort of work?
LADY CHILTERN.  Oh! dull, useful, delightful things, Factory Acts,
Female Inspectors, the Eight Hours' Bill, the Parliamentary
Franchise. . . . Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly
uninteresting.
LORD GORING.  And never bonnets?
LADY CHILTERN.  [With mock indignation.]  Never bonnets, never!
[LADY CHILTERN goes out through the door leading to her boudoir.]
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  [Takes LORD GORING'S hand.]  You have been a
good friend to me, Arthur, a thoroughly good friend.
LORD GORING.  I don't know that I have been able to do much for you,
Robert, as yet.  In fact, I have not been able to do anything for
you, as far as I can see.  I am thoroughly disappointed with myself.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You have enabled me to tell you the truth.
That is something.  The truth has always stifled me.
LORD GORING.  Ah! the truth is a thing I get rid of as soon as
possible!  Bad habit, by the way.  Makes one very unpopular at the
club . . . with the older members.  They call it being conceited.
Perhaps it is.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I would to God that I had been able to tell the
truth . . . to live the truth.  Ah! that is the great thing in life,
to live the truth.  [Sighs, and goes towards the door.]  I'll see you
soon again, Arthur, shan't I?
LORD GORING.  Certainly.  Whenever you like.  I'm going to look in at
the Bachelors' Ball to-night, unless I find something better to do.
But I'll come round to-morrow morning.  If you should want me to-
night by any chance, send round a note to Curzon Street.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Thank you.
[As he reaches the door, LADY CHILTERN enters from her boudoir.]
LADY CHILTERN.  You are not going, Robert?
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I have some letters to write, dear.
LADY CHILTERN.  [Going to him.]  You work too hard, Robert.  You seem
never to think of yourself, and you are looking so tired.
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  It is nothing, dear, nothing.
[He kisses her and goes out.]
LADY CHILTERN.  [To LORD GORING.]  Do sit down.  I am so glad you
have called.  I want to talk to you about . . . well, not about
bonnets, or the Woman's Liberal Association.  You take far too much
interest in the first subject, and not nearly enough in the second.
LORD GORING.  You want to talk to me about Mrs. Cheveley?
LADY CHILTERN.  Yes.  You have guessed it.  After you left last night
I found out that what she had said was really true.  Of course I made
Robert write her a letter at once, withdrawing his promise.
LORD GORING.  So he gave me to understand.
LADY CHILTERN.  To have kept it would have been the first stain on a
career that has been stainless always.  Robert must be above
reproach.  He is not like other men.  He cannot afford to do what
other men do.  [She looks at LORD GORING, who remains silent.]  Don't
you agree with me?  You are Robert's greatest friend.  You are our
greatest friend, Lord Goring.  No one, except myself, knows Robert
better than you do.  He has no secrets from me, and I don't think he
has any from you.
