
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then it is in love with you.
[Exeunt SIR JOHN, LADY STUTFIELD, MR. KELVIL and LORD ALFRED.]
GERALD.  [To LORD ILLINGWORTH]  May I come too?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do, my dear boy.  [Moves towards with MRS.
ALLONBY and GERALD.]
[LADY CAROLINE enters, looks rapidly round and goes off in opposite
direction to that taken by SIR JOHN and LADY STUTFIELD.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!
GERALD.  What, mother!
[Exit LORD ILLINGWORTH with MRS. ALLONBY.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is getting late.  Let us go home.
GERALD.  My dear mother.  Do let us wait a little longer.  Lord
Illingworth is so delightful, and, by the way, mother, I have a
great surprise for you.  We are starting for India at the end of
this month.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let us go home.
GERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid
good-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I'll be back in five minutes.
[Exit.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with him -
not with him!  I couldn't bear it.  [Walks up and down.]
[Enter HESTER.]
HESTER.  What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Is it?
HESTER.  Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be friends.  You
are so different from the other women here.  When you came into the
Drawing-room this evening, somehow you brought with you a sense of
what is good and pure in life.  I had been foolish.  There are
things that are right to say, but that may be said at the wrong
time and to the wrong people.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I heard what you said.  I agree with it, Miss
Worsley.
HESTER.  I didn't know you had heard it.  But I knew you would
agree with me.  A woman who has sinned should be punished,
shouldn't she?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.
HESTER.  She shouldn't be allowed to come into the society of good
men and women?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  She should not.
HESTER.  And the man should be punished in the same way?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  In the same way.  And the children, if there are
children, in the same way also?
HESTER.  Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should be
visited on the children.  It is a just law.  It is God's law.
