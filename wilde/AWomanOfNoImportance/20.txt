
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with
me, for some reason.
GERALD.  Why, mother?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me,
Gerald.  I didn't know you were so anxious to leave me.
GERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been
quite happy with you.  But a man can't stay always with his mother.
No chap does.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.
I thought you would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth's
secretary.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private
secretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don't wish to seem to interfere for a moment,
Mrs. Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I
surely am the best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son
has all the qualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact,
than I had even thought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT remains
silent.]  Have you any other reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don't
wish your son to accept this post?
GERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.
We are quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I
will not repeat it.
GERALD.  Mother?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I
will leave you.  You may have some other reason you don't wish me
to hear.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as
settled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace
together.  And Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think
you have acted very, very wisely.
[Exit with GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT is left alone.  She stands
immobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face.]
