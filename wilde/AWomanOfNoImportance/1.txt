
HESTER.  With pleasure  [Exit with GERALD.]
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot's
good fortune.  He is quite a PROTEGE of mine.  And I am
particularly pleased that Lord Illingworth should have made the
offer of his own accord without my suggesting anything.  Nobody
likes to be asked favours.  I remember poor Charlotte Pagden making
herself quite unpopular one season, because she had a French
governess she wanted to recommend to every one.
LADY CAROLINE.  I saw the governess, Jane.  Lady Pagden sent her to
me.  It was before Eleanor came out.  She was far too good-looking
to be in any respectable household.  I don't wonder Lady Pagden was
so anxious to get rid of her.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that explains it.
LADY CAROLINE.  John, the grass is too damp for you.  You had
better go and put on your overshoes at once.
SIR JOHN.  I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you.
LADY CAROLINE.  You must allow me to be the best judge of that,
John.  Pray do as I tell you.
[SIR JOHN gets up and goes off.]
LADY HUNSTANTON.  You spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed!
[Enter MRS. ALLONBY and LADY STUTFIELD.]
 [To MRS. ALLONBY.]  Well, dear, I hope you like the park.  It is
said to be well timbered.
MRS. ALLONBY.  The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton.
LADY STUTFIELD.  Quite, quite wonderful.
MRS. ALLONBY.  But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the
country for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no
one would take the slightest notice of me.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I assure you, dear, that the country has not that
effect at all.  Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles
from here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale.  I
remember the occurrence perfectly.  Poor Lord Belton died three
days afterwards of joy, or gout.  I forget which.  We had a large
party staying here at the time, so we were all very much interested
in the whole affair.
MRS. ALLONBY.  I think to elope is cowardly.  It's running away
from danger.  And danger has become so rare in modern life.
LADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can make out, the young women of the
present day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be
always playing with fire.
MRS. ALLONBY.  The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady
Caroline, is that one never gets even singed.  It is the people who
don't know how to play with it who get burned up.
LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; I see that.  It is very, very helpful.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I don't know how the world would get on with such
a theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.
LADY STUTFIELD.  Ah!  The world was made for men and not for women.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, don't say that, Lady Stutfield.  We have a much
better time than they have.  There are far more things forbidden to
us than are forbidden to them.
LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; that is quite, quite true.  I had not thought
of that.
[Enter SIR JOHN and MR. KELVIL.]
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?
