
MRS. ALLONBY.  Do you like such simple pleasures?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I adore simple pleasures.  They are the last
refuge of the complex.  But, if you wish, let us stay here.  Yes,
let us stay here.  The Book of Life begins with a man and a woman
in a garden.
MRS. ALLONBY.  It ends with Revelations.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You fence divinely.  But the button has come of
your foil.
MRS. ALLONBY.  I have still the mask.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It makes your eyes lovelier.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Thank you.  Come.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [Sees MRS. ARBUTHNOT'S letter on table, and
takes it up and looks at envelope.]  What a curious handwriting!
It reminds me of the handwriting of a woman I used to know years
ago.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Who?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh! no one.  No one in particular.  A woman of
no importance.  [Throws letter down, and passes up the steps of the
terrace with MRS. ALLONBY.  They smile at each other.]
ACT DROP.
SECOND ACT
SCENE
Drawing-room at Hunstanton, after dinner, lamps lit.  Door L.C.
Door R.C.
[Ladies seated on sofas.]
MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for
a little!
LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don't they?
MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!
MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be
perfectly happy without us.  That is why I think it is every
woman's duty never to leave them alone for a single moment, except
during this short breathing space after dinner; without which I
believe we poor women would be absolutely worn to shadows.
