
LADY CAROLINE.  It is not customary in England, Miss Worsley, for a
young lady to speak with such enthusiasm of any person of the
opposite sex.  English women conceal their feelings till after they
are married.  They show them then.
HESTER.  Do you, in England, allow no friendship to exist between a
young man and a young girl?
[Enter LADY HUNSTANTON, followed by Footman with shawls and a
cushion.]
LADY CAROLINE.  We think it very inadvisable.  Jane, I was just
saying what a pleasant party you have asked us to meet.  You have a
wonderful power of selection.  It is quite a gift.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Dear Caroline, how kind of you!  I think we all
do fit in very nicely together.  And I hope our charming American
visitor will carry back pleasant recollections of our English
country life.  [To Footman.]  The cushion, there, Francis.  And my
shawl.  The Shetland.  Get the Shetland.  [Exit Footman for shawl.]
[Enter GERALD ARBUTHNOT.]
GERALD.  Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to tell you.  Lord
Illingworth has just offered to make me his secretary.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  His secretary?  That is good news indeed, Gerald.
It means a very brilliant future in store for you.  Your dear
mother will be delighted.  I really must try and induce her to come
up here to-night.  Do you think she would, Gerald?  I know how
difficult it is to get her to go anywhere.
GERALD.  Oh!  I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, if she knew
Lord Illingworth had made me such an offer.
[Enter Footman with shawl.]
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I will write and tell her about it, and ask her
to come up and meet him.  [To Footman.]  Just wait, Francis.
[Writes letter.]
LADY CAROLINE.  That is a very wonderful opening for so young a man
as you are, Mr. Arbuthnot.
GERALD.  It is indeed, Lady Caroline.  I trust I shall be able to
show myself worthy of it.
LADY CAROLINE.  I trust so.
GERALD.  [To HESTER.]  YOU have not congratulated me yet, Miss
Worsley.
HESTER.  Are you very pleased about it?
GERALD.  Of course I am.  It means everything to me - things that
were out of the reach of hope before may be within hope's reach
now.
HESTER.  Nothing should be out of the reach of hope.  Life is a
hope.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord
Illingworth is aiming at.  I heard that he was offered Vienna.  But
that may not be true.
LADY CAROLINE.  I don't think that England should be represented
abroad by an unmarried man, Jane.  It might lead to complications.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  You are too nervous, Caroline.  Believe me, you
are too nervous.  Besides, Lord Illingworth may marry any day.  I
was in hopes he would have married lady Kelso.  But I believe he
said her family was too large.  Or was it her feet?  I forget
which.  I regret it very much.  She was made to be an ambassador's
wife.
LADY CAROLINE.  She certainly has a wonderful faculty of
remembering people's names, and forgetting their faces.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, that is very natural, Caroline, is it not?
[To Footman.]  Tell Henry to wait for an answer.  I have written a
line to your dear mother, Gerald, to tell her your good news, and
to say she really must come to dinner.
[Exit Footman.]
GERALD.  That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton.  [To
HESTER.]  Will you come for a stroll, Miss Worsley?
