
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is, Lady Caroline.  That is why, like Eve,
they are so extremely anxious to get out of it.
LADY CAROLINE.  Who are Miss Worsley's parents?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  American women are wonderfully clever in
concealing their parents.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Lord Illingworth, what do you mean?  Miss
Worsley, Caroline, is an orphan.  Her father was a very wealthy
millionaire or philanthropist, or both, I believe, who entertained
my son quite hospitably, when he visited Boston.  I don't know how
he made his money, originally.
KELVIL.  I fancy in American dry goods.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  What are American dry goods?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  American novels.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  How very singular! . . . Well, from whatever
source her large fortune came, I have a great esteem for Miss
Worsley.  She dresses exceedingly well.  All Americans do dress
well.  They get their clothes in Paris.
MRS. ALLONBY.  They say, Lady Hunstanton, that when good Americans
die they go to Paris.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Indeed?  And when bad Americans die, where do
they go to?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, they go to America.
KELVIL.  I am afraid you don't appreciate America, Lord
Illingworth.  It is a very remarkable country, especially
considering its youth.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The youth of America is their oldest tradition.
It has been going on now for three hundred years.  To hear them
talk one would imagine they were in their first childhood.  As far
as civilisation goes they are in their second.
KELVIL.  There is undoubtedly a great deal of corruption in
American politics.  I suppose you allude to that?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I wonder.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Politics are in a sad way everywhere, I am told.
They certainly are in England.  Dear Mr. Cardew is ruining the
country.  I wonder Mrs. Cardew allows him.  I am sure, Lord
Illingworth, you don't think that uneducated people should be
allowed to have votes?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I think they are the only people who should.
KELVIL.  Do you take no side then in modern politics, Lord
Illingworth?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never take sides in anything, Mr.
Kelvil.  Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, and
earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and the human being becomes
a bore.  However, the House of Commons really does very little
harm.  You can't make people good by Act of Parliament, - that is
something.
KELVIL.  You cannot deny that the House of Commons has always shown
great sympathy with the sufferings of the poor.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is its special vice.  That is the special
vice of the age.  One should sympathise with the joy, the beauty,
the colour of life.  The less said about life's sores the better,
Mr. Kelvil.
KELVIL.  Still our East End is a very important problem.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  It is the problem of slavery.  And we
are trying to solve it by amusing the slaves.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, a great deal may be done by means of
cheap entertainments, as you say, Lord Illingworth.  Dear Dr.
Daubeny, our rector here, provides, with the assistance of his
curates, really admirable recreations for the poor during the
winter.  And much good may be done by means of a magic lantern, or
a missionary, or some popular amusement of that kind.
LADY CAROLINE.  I am not at all in favour of amusements for the
poor, Jane.  Blankets and coals are sufficient.  There is too much
love of pleasure amongst the upper classes as it is.  Health is
what we want in modern life.  The tone is not healthy, not healthy
at all.
