
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! the Music-room, of course.  I thought it was
the Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is getting so defective.  [To
the ARCHDEACON.]  Mrs. Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn't she?
THE ARCHDEACON.  She used to be quite remarkable for her memory,
but since her last attack she recalls chiefly the events of her
early childhood.  But she finds great pleasure in such
retrospections, great pleasure.
[Enter LADY STUTFIELD and MR. KELVIL.]
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! dear Lady Stutfield! and what has Mr. Kelvil
been talking to you about?
LADY STUTFIELD.  About Bimetallism, as well as I remember.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Bimetallism!  Is that quite a nice subject?
However, I know people discuss everything very freely nowadays.
What did Sir John talk to you about, dear Mrs. Allonby?
MRS. ALLONBY.  About Patagonia.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a remote topic!  But very
improving, I have no doubt.
MRS. ALLONBY.  He has been most interesting on the subject of
Patagonia.  Savages seem to have quite the same views as cultured
people on almost all subjects.  They are excessively advanced.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  What do they do?
MRS. ALLONBY.  Apparently everything.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is
it not, to find that Human Nature is permanently one. - On the
whole, the world is the same world, is it not?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The world is simply divided into two classes -
those who believe the incredible, like the public - and those who
do the improbable -
MRS. ALLONBY.  Like yourself?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Yes; I am always astonishing myself.  It is the
only thing that makes life worth living.
LADY STUTFIELD.  And what have you been doing lately that
astonishes you?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful
qualities in my own nature.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah! don't become quite perfect all at once.  Do it
gradually!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don't intend to grow perfect at all.  At
least, I hope I shan't.  It would be most inconvenient.  Women love
us for our defects.  If we have enough of them, they will forgive
us everything, even our gigantic intellects.
MRS. ALLONBY.  It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis.  We
forgive adoration; that is quite as much as should be expected from
us.
[Enter LORD ALFRED.  He joins LADY STUTFIELD.]
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah! we women should forgive everything, shouldn't
we, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot?  I am sure you agree with me in that.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not, Lady Hunstanton.  I think there are many
things women should never forgive.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  What sort of things?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  The ruin of another woman's life.
