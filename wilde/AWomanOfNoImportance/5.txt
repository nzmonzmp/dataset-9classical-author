
LADY STUTFIELD.  But there is so much unkind scandal in modern
life.
LADY CAROLINE.  Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night at
dinner that the basis of every scandal is an absolutely immoral
certainty.
KELVIL.  Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant man, but
he seems to me to be lacking in that fine faith in the nobility and
purity of life which is so important in this century.
LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, quite, quite important, is it not?
KELVIL.  He gives me the impression of a man who does not
appreciate the beauty of our English home-life.  I would say that
he was tainted with foreign ideas on the subject.
LADY STUTFIELD.  There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of home-
life, is there?
KELVIL.  It is the mainstay of our moral system in England, Lady
Stutfield.  Without it we would become like our neighbours.
LADY STUTFIELD.  That would be so, so sad, would it not?
KELVIL.  I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards woman
simply as a toy.  Now, I have never regarded woman as a toy.  Woman
is the intellectual helpmeet of man in public as in private life.
Without her we should forget the true ideals.  [Sits down beside
LADY STUTFIELD.]
LADY STUTFIELD.  I am so very, very glad to hear you say that.
LADY CAROLINE.  You a married man, Mr. Kettle?
SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, dear, Kelvil.
KELVIL.  I am married, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE.  Family?
KELVIL.  Yes.
LADY CAROLINE.  How many?
KELVIL.  Eight.
[LADY STUTFIELD turns her attention to LORD ALFRED.]
LADY CAROLINE.  Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at the
seaside?  [SIR JOHN shrugs his shoulders.]
KELVIL.  My wife is at the seaside with the children, Lady
Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE.  You will join them later on, no doubt?
KELVIL.  If my public engagements permit me.
LADY CAROLINE.  Your public life must be a great source of
gratification to Mrs. Kettle.
SIR JOHN.  Kelvil, my love, Kelvil.
LADY STUTFIELD.  [To LORD ALFRED.]  How very, very charming those
gold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord Alfred.
