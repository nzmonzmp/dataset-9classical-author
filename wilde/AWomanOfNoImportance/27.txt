
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It is one of God's terrible laws.
[Moves away to fireplace.]
HESTER.  You are distressed about your son leaving you, Mrs.
Arbuthnot?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Yes.
HESTER.  Do you like him going away with Lord Illingworth?  Of
course there is position, no doubt, and money, but position and
money are not everything, are they?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  They are nothing; they bring misery.
HESTER.  Then why do you let your son go with him?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He wishes it himself.
HESTER.  But if you asked him he would stay, would he not?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He has set his heart on going.
HESTER.  He couldn't refuse you anything.  He loves you too much.
Ask him to stay.  Let me send him in to you.  He is on the terrace
at this moment with Lord Illingworth.  I heard them laughing
together as I passed through the Music-room.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Don't trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait.  It is of
no consequence.
HESTER.  No, I'll tell him you want him.  Do - do ask him to stay.
[Exit HESTER.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He won't come - I know he won't come.
[Enter LADY CAROLINE.  She looks round anxiously.  Enter GERALD.]
LADY CAROLINE.  Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John anywhere
on the terrace?
GERALD.  No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace.
LADY CAROLINE.  It is very curious.  It is time for him to retire.
[Exit LADY CAROLINE.]
GERALD.  Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting.  I forgot all
about it.  I am so happy to-night, mother; I have never been so
happy.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  At the prospect of going away?
GERALD.  Don't put it like that, mother.  Of course I am sorry to
leave you.  Why, you are the best mother in the whole world.  But
after all, as Lord Illingworth says, it is impossible to live in
such a place as Wrockley.  You don't mind it.  But I'm ambitions; I
want something more than that.  I want to have a career.  I want to
do something that will make you proud of me, and Lord Illingworth
is going to help me.  He is going to do everything for me.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, don't go away with Lord Illingworth.  I
implore you not to.  Gerald, I beg you!
GERALD.  Mother, how changeable you are!  You don't seem to know
your own mind for a single moment.  An hour and a half ago in the
Drawing-room you agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round and
make objections, and try to force me to give up my one chance in
life.  Yes, my one chance.  You don't suppose that men like Lord
Illingworth are to be found every day, do you, mother?  It is very
strange that when I have had such a wonderful piece of good luck,
the one person to put difficulties in my way should be my own
mother.  Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester Worsley.  Who
could help loving her?  I love her more than I have ever told you,
far more.  And if I had a position, if I had prospects, I could - I
could ask her to - Don't you understand now, mother, what it means
to me to be Lord Illingworth's secretary?  To start like that is to
find a career ready for one - before one - waiting for one.  If I
were Lord Illingworth's secretary I could ask Hester to be my wife.
As a wretched bank clerk with a hundred a year it would be an
impertinence.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley.  I
know her views on life.  She has just told them to me.  [A pause.]
