
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I
suppose it is something in their climate.  What did she lecture
about?
MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long
do you give me?
MRS. ALLONBY.  A week.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.
[Enter GERALD and LORD ALFRED.]
GERALD.  [Going to MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don't feel at all well.  See me home,
Gerald.  I shouldn't have come.
GERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord
Illingworth first.  [Goes across room.]
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.
GERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [To MRS. ALLONBY.]
I'll be back in a moment.  People's mothers always bore me to
death.  All women become like their mothers.  That is their
tragedy.
MRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!
[Turns round and goes across with GERALD to MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When
he sees her, he starts back in wonder.  Then slowly his eyes turn
towards GERALD.]
GERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take
me as his private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT bows coldly.]  It is
a wonderful opening for me, isn't it?  I hope he won't be
disappointed in me, that is all.  You'll thank Lord Illingworth,
mother, won't you?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to
interest himself in you for the moment.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [Putting his hand on GERALD's shoulder.]  Oh,
Gerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my
son, Lord Illingworth.
GERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord
Illingworth is awfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is
nothing Lord Illingworth doesn't know.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!
GERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I
feel an awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of
course, I have had so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or
Oxford like other chaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn't seem to mind
that.  He has been awfully good to me, mother.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not
really want you as his secretary.
GERALD.  Mother!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have
had so few advantages.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a
moment.  Do come over.
