
KELVIL.  You are quite right, Lady Caroline.
LADY CAROLINE.  I believe I am usually right.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Horrid word 'health.'
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Silliest word in our language, and one knows so
well the popular idea of health.  The English country gentleman
galloping after a fox - the unspeakable in full pursuit of the
uneatable.
KELVIL.  May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard the House of
Lords as a better institution than the House of Commons?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A much better institution, of course.  We in the
House of Lords are never in touch with public opinion.  That makes
us a civilised body.
KELVIL.  Are you serious in putting forward such a view?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil.  [To MRS. ALLONBY.]
Vulgar habit that is people have nowadays of asking one, after one
has given them an idea, whether one is serious or not.  Nothing is
serious except passion.  The intellect is not a serious thing, and
never has been.  It is an instrument on which one plays, that is
all.  The only serious form of intellect I know is the British
intellect.  And on the British intellect the illiterates play the
drum.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  What are you saying, Lord Illingworth, about the
drum?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was merely talking to Mrs. Allonby about the
leading articles in the London newspapers.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you believe all that is written in the
newspapers?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I do.  Nowadays it is only the unreadable that
occurs.  [Rises with MRS. ALLONBY.]
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Are you going, Mrs. Allonby?
MRS. ALLONBY.  Just as far as the conservatory.  Lord Illingworth
told me this morning that there was an orchid there m beautiful as
the seven deadly sins.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind.  I
will certainly speak to the gardener.
[Exit MRS. ALLONBY and LORD ILLINGWORTH.]
LADY CAROLINE.  Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  She lets her clever tongue run away with her
sometimes.
LADY CAROLINE.  Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows
to run away with her?
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope so, Caroline, I am sure.
[Enter LORD ALFRED.]
Dear Lord Alfred, do join us.  [LORD ALFRED sits down beside LADY
STUTFIELD.]
LADY CAROLINE.  You believe good of every one, Jane.  It is a great
fault.
LADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that
one should believe evil of every one?
LADY CAROLINE.  I think it is much safer to do so, Lady Stutfield.
Until, of course, people are found out to be good.  But that
requires a great deal of investigation nowadays.
