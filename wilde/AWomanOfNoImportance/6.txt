
LORD ALFRED.  They are awfully expensive.  I can only afford them
when I'm in debt.
LADY STUTFIELD.  It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be in
debt.
LORD ALFRED.  One must have some occupation nowadays.  If I hadn't
my debts I shouldn't have anything to think about.  All the chaps I
know are in debt.
LADY STUTFIELD.  But don't the people to whom you owe the money
give you a great, great deal of annoyance?
[Enter Footman.]
LORD ALFRED.  Oh, no, they write; I don't.
LADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very strange.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs.
Arbuthnot.  She won't dine.  I am so sorry.  But she will come in
the evening.  I am very pleased indeed.  She is one of the sweetest
of women.  Writes a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm.  [Hands
letter to LADY CAROLINE.]
LADY CAROLINE.  [Looking at it.]  A little lacking in femininity,
Jane.  Femininity is the quality I admire most in women.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  [Taking back letter and leaving it on table.]
Oh! she is very feminine, Caroline, and so good too.  You should
hear what the Archdeacon says of her.  He regards her as his right
hand in the parish.  [Footman speaks to her.]  In the Yellow
Drawing-room.  Shall we all go in?  Lady Stutfield, shall we go in
to tea?
LADY STUTFIELD.  With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton.  [They rise and
proceed to go off.  SIR JOHN offers to carry LADY STUTFIELD'S
cloak.]
LADY CAROLINE.  John!  If you would allow your nephew to look after
Lady Stutfield's cloak, you might help me with my workbasket.
[Enter LORD ILLINGWORTH and MRS. ALLONBY.]
SIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  [Exeunt.]
MRS. ALLONBY.  Curious thing, plain women are always jealous of
their husbands, beautiful women never are!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Beautiful women never have time.  They are
always so occupied in being jealous of other people's husbands.
MRS. ALLONBY.  I should have thought Lady Caroline would have grown
tired of conjugal anxiety by this time!  Sir John is her fourth!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So much marriage is certainly not becoming.
Twenty years of romance make a woman look like a ruin; but twenty
years of marriage make her something like a public building.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Twenty years of romance!  Is there such a thing?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Not in our day.  Women have become too
brilliant.  Nothing spoils a romance so much as a sense of humour
in the woman.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Or the want of it in the man.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are quite right.  In a Temple every one
should be serious, except the thing that is worshipped.
MRS. ALLONBY.  And that should be man?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Women kneel so gracefully; men don't.
MRS. ALLONBY.  You are thinking of Lady Stutfield!
