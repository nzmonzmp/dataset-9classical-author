
MRS. ALLONBY.  They are uninteresting then.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How tantalising you are!  [A pause.]
MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall always
like you for.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only one thing?  And I have so many bad
qualities.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, don't be too conceited about them.  You may lose
them as you grow old.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I never intend to grow old.  The soul is born
old but grows young.  That is the comedy of life.
MRS. ALLONBY.  And the body is born young and grows old.  That is
life's tragedy.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Its comedy also, sometimes.  But what is the
mysterious reason why you will always like me?
MRS. ALLONBY.  It is that you have never made love to me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I have never done anything else.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Really?  I have not noticed it.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How fortunate!  It might have been a tragedy for
both of us.
MRS. ALLONBY.  We should each have survived.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One can survive everything nowadays, except
death, and live down anything except a good reputation.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Have you tried a good reputation?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of the many annoyances to which I have
never been subjected.
MRS. ALLONBY.  It may come.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why do you threaten me?
MRS. ALLONBY.  I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan.
[Enter Footman.]
FRANCIS.  Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my lord.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Tell her ladyship we are coming in.
FRANCIS.  Yes, my lord.
[Exit.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Shall we go in to tea?
