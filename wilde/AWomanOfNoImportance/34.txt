
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But we are disgraced.  We rank among the outcasts
Gerald is nameless.  The sins of the parents should be visited on
the children.  It is God's law.
HESTER.  I was wrong.  God's law is only Love.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [Rises, and taking HESTER by the hand, goes slowly
over to where GERALD is lying on the sofa with his head buried in
his hands.  She touches him and he looks up.]  Gerald, I cannot
give you a father, but I have brought you a wife.
GERALD.  Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  So she comes first, you are worthy.  And when you
are away, Gerald . . . with . . . her - oh, think of me sometimes.
Don't forget me.  And when you pray, pray for me.  We should pray
when we are happiest, and you will be happy, Gerald.
HESTER.  Oh, you don't think of leaving us?
GERALD.  Mother, you won't leave us?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I might bring shame upon you!
GERALD.  Mother!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  For a little then: and if you let me, near you
always.
HESTER.  [To MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Come out with us to the garden.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Later on, later on.  [Exeunt HESTER and GERALD.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT goes towards door L.C.   Stops at looking-glass over
mantelpiece and looks into it.  Enter ALICE R.C.]
ALICE.  A gentleman to see you, ma'am.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Say I am not at home.  Show me the card.  [Takes
card from salver and looks at it.]  Say I will not see him.
[LORD ILLINGWORTH enters.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT sees him in the glass and
starts, but does not turn round.  Exit ALICE.]  What can you have
to say to me to-day, George Harford?  You can have nothing to say
to me.  You must leave this house.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you and me
now, so some arrangement must be come to that will suit us all
three.  I assure you, he will find in me the most charming and
generous of fathers.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son may come in at any moment.  I saved you
last night.  I may not be able to save you again.  My son feels my
dishonour strongly, terribly strongly.  I beg you to go.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [Sitting down.]  Last night was excessively
unfortunate.  That silly Puritan girl making a scene merely because
I wanted to kiss her.  What harm is there in a kiss?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [Turning round.]  A kiss may ruin a human life,
George Harford.  I know that.  I know that too well.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  We won't discuss that at present.  What is of
importance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son.  I am extremely
fond of him, as you know, and odd though it may seem to you, I
admired his conduct last night immensely.  He took up the cudgels
for that pretty prude with wonderful promptitude.  He is just what
I should have liked a son of mine to be.  Except that no son of
mine should ever take the side of the Puritans: that is always an
error.  Now, what I propose is this.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth, no proposition of yours
interests me.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  According to our ridiculous English laws, I
can't legitimise Gerald.  But I can leave him my property.
Illingworth is entailed, of course, but it is a tedious barrack of
a place.  He can have Ashby, which is much prettier, Harborough,
which has the best shooting in the north of England, and the house
in St. James Square.  What more can a gentleman require in this
world?
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Nothing more, I am quite sure.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  As for a title, a title is really rather a
nuisance in these democratic days.  As George Harford I had
everything I wanted.  Now I have merely everything that other
people want, which isn't nearly so pleasant.  Well, my proposal is
this.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I told you I was not interested, and I beg you to
go.
