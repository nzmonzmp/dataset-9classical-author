
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To get into the best society, nowadays, one has
either to feed people, amuse people, or shock people - that is all!
GERALD.  I suppose society is wonderfully delightful!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  To be in it is merely a bore.  But to be out of
it simply a tragedy.  Society is a necessary thing.  No man has any
real success in this world unless he has got women to back him, and
women rule society.  If you have not got women on your side you are
quite over.  You might just as well be a barrister, or a
stockbroker, or a journalist at once.
GERALD.  It is very difficult to understand women, is it not?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You should never try to understand them.  Women
are pictures.  Men are problems.  If you want to know what a woman
really means - which, by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do
- look at her, don't listen to her.
GERALD.  But women are awfully clever, aren't they?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always tell them so.  But, to the
philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the triumph of matter
over mind - just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.
GERALD.  How then can women have so much power as you say they
have?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  The history of women is the history of the worst
form of tyranny the world has ever known.  The tyranny of the weak
over the strong.  It is the only tyranny that lasts.
GERALD.  But haven't women got a refining influence?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Nothing refines but the intellect.
GERALD.  Still, there are many different kinds of women, aren't
there?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Only two kinds in society: the plain and the
coloured.
GERALD.  But there are good women in society, aren't there?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Far too many.
GERALD.  But do you think women shouldn't be good?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never tell them so, they'd all become
good at once.  Women are a fascinatingly wilful sex.  Every woman
is a rebel, and usually in wild revolt against herself.
GERALD.  You have never been married, Lord Illingworth, have you?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Men marry because they are tired; women because
they are curious.  Both are disappointed.
GERALD.  But don't you think one can be happy when one is married?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Perfectly happy.  But the happiness of a married
man, my dear Gerald, depends on the people he has not married.
GERALD.  But if one is in love?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should always be in love.  That is the
reason one should never marry.
GERALD.  Love is a very wonderful thing, isn't it?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  When one is in love one begins by deceiving
oneself.  And one ends by deceiving others.  That is what the world
calls a romance.  But a really GRANDE PASSION is comparatively rare
nowadays.  It is the privilege of people who have nothing to do.
That is the one use of the idle classes in a country, and the only
possible explanation of us Harfords.
