
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I assure you I have not thought of Lady
Stutfield for the last quarter of an hour.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Is she such a mystery?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is more than a mystery - she is a mood.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Moods don't last.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is their chief charm.
[Enter HESTER and GERALD.]
GERALD.  Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratulating me,
Lady Hunstanton and Lady Caroline, and . . . every one.  I hope I
shall make a good secretary.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald.
[Talks to him.]
MRS. ALLONBY.  You enjoy country life, Miss Worsley?
HESTER.  Very much indeed.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Don't find yourself longing for a London dinner-
party?
HESTER.  I dislike London dinner-parties.
MRS. ALLONBY.  I adore them.  The clever people never listen, and
the stupid people never talk.
HESTER.  I think the stupid people talk a great deal.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, I never listen!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy, if I didn't like you I wouldn't
have made you the offer.  It is because I like you so much that I
want to have you with me.
[Exit HESTER with GERALD.]
Charming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot!
MRS. ALLONBY.  He is very nice; very nice indeed.  But I can't
stand the American young lady.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Why?
MRS. ALLONBY.  She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud voice
too, that she was only eighteen.  It was most annoying.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  One should never trust a woman who tells one her
real age.  A woman who would tell one that, would tell one
anything.
MRS. ALLONBY.  She is a Puritan besides -
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Ah, that is inexcusable.  I don't mind plain
women being Puritans.  It is the only excuse they have for being
plain.  But she is decidedly pretty.  I admire her immensely.
[Looks steadfastly at MRS. ALLONBY.]
MRS. ALLONBY.  What a thoroughly bad man you must be!
