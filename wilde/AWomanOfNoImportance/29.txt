
GERALD.  Who?  Who has dared - ?
[LORD ILLINGWORTH enters at back of stage.  HESTER breaks from
GERALD'S arms and points to him.]
GERALD  [He is quite beside himself with rage and indignation.]
Lord Illingworth, you have insulted the purest thing on God's
earth, a thing as pure as my own mother.  You have insulted the
woman I love most in the world with my own mother.  As there is a
God in Heaven, I will kill you!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  [Rushing across and catching hold of him]  No! no!
GERALD.  [Thrusting her back.]  Don't hold me, mother.  Don't hold
me - I'll kill him!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald!
GERALD.  Let me go, I say!
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Stop, Gerald, stop!  He is your own father!
[GERALD clutches his mother's hands and looks into her face.  She
sinks slowly on the ground in shame.  HESTER steals towards the
door.  LORD ILLINGWORTH frowns and bites his lip.  After a time
GERALD raises his mother up, puts his am round her, and leads her
from the room.]
