
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you call a bad man?
MRS. ALLONBY.  The sort of man who admires innocence.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  And a bad woman?
MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh! the sort of woman a man never gets tired of.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You are severe - on yourself.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Define us as a sex.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Sphinxes without secrets.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Does that include the Puritan women?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Do you know, I don't believe in the existence of
Puritan women?  I don't think there is a woman in the world who
would not be a little flattered if one made love to her.  It is
that which makes women so irresistibly adorable.
MRS. ALLONBY.  You think there is no woman in the world who would
object to being kissed?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Very few.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Are you sure?
MRS. ALLONBY.  Quite.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What do you think she'd do if I kissed her?
MRS. ALLONBY.  Either marry you, or strike you across the face with
her glove.  What would you do if she struck you across the face
with her glove?
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Fall in love with her, probably.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her!
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Is that a challenge?
MRS. ALLONBY.  It is an arrow shot into the air.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Don't you know that I always succeed in whatever
I try?
MRS. ALLONBY.  I am sorry to hear it.  We women adore failures.
They lean on us.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You worship successes.  You cling to them.
MRS. ALLONBY.  We are the laurels to hide their baldness.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  And they need you always, except at the moment
of triumph.
