LADY  HUNSTANTON.  Ah! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I
believe there are admirable homes where people of that kind are
looked after and reformed, and I think on the whole that the secret
of life is to take things very, very easily.
MRS. ALLONBY.  The secret of life is never to have an emotion that
is unbecoming.
LADY STUTFIELD.  The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure
of being terribly, terribly deceived.
KELVIL.  The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady
Stutfield.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  There is no secret of life.  Life's aim, if it
has one, is simply to be always looking for temptations.  There are
not nearly enough.  I sometimes pass a whole day without coming
across a single one.  It is quite dreadful.  It makes one so
nervous about the future.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  [Shakes her fan at him.]  I don't know how it is,
dear Lord Illingworth, but everything you have said to-day seems to
me excessively immoral.  It has been most interesting, listening to
you.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  All thought is immoral.  Its very essence is
destruction.  If you think of anything, you kill it.  Nothing
survives being thought of.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I don't understand a word, Lord Illingworth.  But
I have no doubt it is all quite true.  Personally, I have very
little to reproach myself with, on the score of thinking.  I don't
believe in women thinking too much.  Women should think in
moderation, as they should do all things in moderation.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Moderation is a fatal thing, Lady Hunstanton.
Nothing succeeds like excess.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hope I shall remember that.  It sounds an
admirable maxim.  But I'm beginning to forget everything.  It's a
great misfortune.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is one of your most fascinating qualities,
Lady Hunstanton.  No woman should have a memory.  Memory in a woman
is the beginning of dowdiness.  One can always tell from a woman's
bonnet whether she has got a memory or not.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth.  You
always find out that one's most glaring fault is one's most
important virtue.  You have the most comforting views of life.
[Enter FARQUHAR.]
FARQUHAR.  Doctor Daubeny's carriage!
LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Archdeacon!  It is only half-past ten.
THE ARCHDEACON.  [Rising.]  I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton.
Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny's bad nights.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  [Rising.]  Well, I won't keep you from her.
[Goes with him towards door.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace
of partridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.
THE ARCHDEACON.  It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never
touches solids now.  Lives entirely on jellies.  But she is
wonderfully cheerful, wonderfully cheerful.  She has nothing to
complain of.
[Exit with LADY HUNSTANTON.]
MRS. ALLONBY.  [Goes over to LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  There is a
beautiful moon to-night.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Let us go and look at it.  To look at anything
that is inconstant is charming nowadays.
MRS. ALLONBY.  You have your looking-glass.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  It is unkind.  It merely shows me my wrinkles.
MRS. ALLONBY.  Mine is better behaved.  It never tells me the
truth.
