
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.
He was a very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or
wouldn't, I believe.  There was some scandal about it.  The present
Lord Illingworth is quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He
does - well, he does nothing, which I am afraid our pretty American
visitor here thinks very wrong of anybody, and I don't know that he
cares much for the subjects in which you are so interested, dear
Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think, Caroline, that Lord Illingworth is
interested in the Housing of the Poor?
LADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?
But Lord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing
he couldn't get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is
comparatively a young man still, and he has only come to his title
within - how long exactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth
succeeded?
LADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the
same year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening
newspapers.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years
ago.  Of course, there were a great many people between the present
Lord Illingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was - who
was there, Caroline?
LADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret's baby.  You remember how
anxious she was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and
her husband died shortly afterwards, and she married almost
immediately one of Lord Ascot's sons, who, I am told, beats her.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the
family.  And there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to
be a lunatic, or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget
which, but I know the Court of Chancery investigated the matter,
and decided that he was quite sane.  And I saw him afterwards at
poor Lord Plumstead's with straws in his hair, or something very
odd about him.  I can't recall what.  I often regret, Lady
Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son get the
title.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?
LADY  HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth's mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,
was one of the Duchess of Jerningham's pretty daughters, and she
married Sir Thomas Harford, who wasn't considered a very good match
for her at the time, though he was said to be the handsomest man in
London.  I knew them all quite intimately, and both the sons,
Arthur and George.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course,
Lady Hunstanton?
LADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or
was it fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for
everything.  I always tell him that no younger son has ever had
such good luck as he has had.
MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at
once.  Might I see him?  Can he be sent for?
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants
into the dining-room to fetch him.  I don't know what keeps the
gentlemen so long.  [Rings bell.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth
first as plain George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young
man about town, with not a penny of money except what poor dear
Lady Cecilia gave him.  She was quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I
fancy, because he was on bad terms with his father.  Oh, here is
the dear Archdeacon.  [To Servant.]  It doesn't matter.
[Enter SIR JOHN and DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN goes over to LADY
STUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY to LADY HUNSTANTON.]
THE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I
have never enjoyed myself more.  [Sees MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs.
Arbuthnot.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  [To DOCTOR DAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.
Arbuthnot to come to me at last.
THE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs.
Daubeny will be quite jealous of you.
LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come
with you to-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.
THE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she
is happiest alone.  She is happiest alone.
LADY CAROLINE.  [To her husband.]  John!  [SIR JOHN goes over to
his wife.  DOCTOR DAUBENY talks to LADY HUNSTANTON and MRS.
ARBUTHNOT.]
[MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has
passed across the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS.
ALLONBY, who with LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on
to the terrace.]
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?
MRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both
quite well, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you
have been in the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just
left.
LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the
whole time.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.
MRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving
us a lecture.
