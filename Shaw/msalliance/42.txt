
MRS TARLETON.  _[coming to Tarleton]_  Whats been going on?  Dont you
hold anything back from me, John.  What have you been doing?
TARLETON.  Bentley isnt going to marry Patsy.
MRS TARLETON.  Of course not.  Is that your great news?  I never
believed she'd marry him.
TARLETON.  Theres something else.  Mr Percival here--
MRS TARLETON.  _[to Percival]_  Are you going to marry Patsy?
PERCIVAL _[diplomatically]_  Patsy is going to marry me, with your
permission.
MRS TARLETON.  Oh, she has my permission:  she ought to have been
married long ago.
HYPATIA.  Mother!
TARLETON.  Miss Lina here, though she has been so short a time with
us, has inspired a good deal of attachment in--I may say in almost all
of us.  Therefore I hope she'll stay to dinner, and not insist on
flying away in that aeroplane.
PERCIVAL.  You must stay, Miss Szczepanowska.  I cant go up again this
evening.
LINA.  Ive seen you work it.  Do you think I require any help?  And
Bentley shall come with me as a passenger.
BENTLEY.  _[terrified]_  Go up in an aeroplane!  I darent.
LINA.  You must learn to dare.
BENTLEY.  _[pale but heroic]_  All right.  I'll come.
LORD SUMMERHAYS|    No, no, Bentley, impossible.  I
               |    shall not allow it.
               |
MRS TARLETON.  |    Do you want to kill the child?  He shant go.
BENTLEY.  I will.  I'll lie down and yell until you let me go.  I'm
not a coward.  I wont be a coward.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Miss Szczepanowska:  my son is very dear to me.  I
implore you to wait until tomorrow morning.
LINA.  There may be a storm tomorrow.  And I'll go:  storm or no
storm.  I must risk my life tomorrow.
BENTLEY.  I hope there will be a storm.
LINA.  _[grasping his arm]_  You are trembling.
BENTLEY.  Yes:  it's terror, sheer terror.  I can hardly see.  I can
hardly stand.  But I'll go with you.
LINA.  _[slapping him on the back and knocking a ghastly white smile
into his face]_  You shall.  I like you, my boy.  We go tomorrow,
together.
BENTLEY.  Yes:  together:  tomorrow.
TARLETON.  Well, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.  Read
the old book.
MRS TARLETON.  Is there anything else?
