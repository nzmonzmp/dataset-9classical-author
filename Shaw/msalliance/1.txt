
_Hypatia rushes in through the inner door, followed by Mrs Tarleton,
and throws herself on her knees by Bentley.  Mrs Tarleton, whose knees
are stiffer, bends over him and tries to lift him.  Mrs Tarleton is a
shrewd and motherly old lady who has been pretty in her time, and is
still very pleasant and likeable and unaffected.  Hypatia is a typical
English girl of a sort never called typical:  that is, she has an
opaque white skin, black hair, large dark eyes with black brows and
lashes, curved lips, swift glances and movements that flash out of a
waiting stillness, boundless energy and audacity held in leash._
HYPATIA.  _[pouncing on Bentley with no very gentle hand]_  Bentley:
whats the matter?  Dont cry like that:  whats the use?  Whats
happened?
MRS TARLETON.  Are you ill, child?  _[They get him up.  There, there,
pet!  It's all right:  dont cry _[they put him into a chair]_:  there!
there! there!  Johnny will go for the doctor; and he'll give you
something nice to make it well.
HYPATIA.  What has happened, Johnny?
MRS TARLETON.  Was it a wasp?
BENTLEY.  _[impatiently]_  Wasp be dashed!
MRS TARLETON.  Oh Bunny! that was a naughty word.
BENTLEY.  Yes, I know:  I beg your pardon.  _[He rises, and extricates
himself from them]_  Thats all right.  Johnny frightened me.  You know
how easy it is to hurt me; and I'm too small to defend myself against
Johnny.
MRS TARLETON.  Johnny:  how often have I told you that you must not
bully the little ones.  I thought youd outgrown all that.
HYPATIA.  _[angrily]_  I do declare, mamma, that Johnny's brutality
makes it impossible to live in the house with him.
JOHNNY.  _[deeply hurt]_  It's twenty-seven years, mother, since you
had that row with me for licking Robert and giving Hypatia a black eye
because she bit me.  I promised you then that I'd never raise my hand
to one of them again; and Ive never broken my word.  And now because
this young whelp begins to cry out before he's hurt, you treat me as
if I were a brute and a savage.
MRS TARLETON.  No dear, not a savage; but you know you must not call
our visitor naughty names.
BENTLEY.  Oh, let him alone--
JOHNNY.  _[fiercely]_  Dont you interfere between my mother and me:
d'y' hear?
HYPATIA.  Johnny's lost his temper, mother.  We'd better go.  Come,
Bentley.
MRS TARLETON.  Yes:  that will be best.  _[To Bentley]_  Johnny doesnt
mean any harm, dear:  he'll be himself presently.  Come.
_The two ladies go out through the inner door with Bentley, who turns
at the door to grin at Johnny as he goes out._
_Johnny, left alone, clenches his fists and grinds his teeth, but can
find no relief in that way for his rage.  After choking and stamping
for a moment, he makes for the vestibule door.  It opens before he
reaches it; and Lord Summerhays comes in.  Johnny glares at him,
speechless.  Lord Summerhays takes in the situation, and quickly takes
the punchbowl from the sideboard and offers it to Johnny._
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Smash it.  Dont hesitate:  it's an ugly thing.
Smash it:  hard.  _[Johnny, with a stifled yell, dashes it in pieces,
and then sits down and mops his brow]._  Feel better now?  _[Johnny
nods]._  I know only one person alive who could drive me to the point
of having either to break china or commit murder; and that person is
my son Bentley.  Was it he?  _[Johnny nods again, not yet able to
speak]._  As the car stopped I heard a yell which is only too familiar
to me.  It generally means that some infuriated person is trying to
thrash Bentley.  Nobody has ever succeeded, though almost everybody
has tried.  _[He seats himself comfortably close to the writing table,
and sets to work to collect the fragments of the punchbowl in the
wastepaper basket whilst Johnny, with diminishing difficulty, collects
himself]._  Bentley is a problem which I confess I have never been
able to solve.  He was born to be a great success at the age of fifty.
Most Englishmen of his class seem to be born to be great successes at
the age of twenty-four at most.  The domestic problem for me is how to
endure Bentley until he is fifty.  The problem for the nation is how
to get itself governed by men whose growth is arrested when they are
little more than college lads.  Bentley doesnt really mean to be
offensive.  You can always make him cry by telling him you dont like
him.  Only, he cries so loud that the experiment should be made in the
open air:  in the middle of Salisbury Plain if possible.  He has a
hard and penetrating intellect and a remarkable power of looking facts
in the face; but unfortunately, being very young, he has no idea of
how very little of that sort of thing most of us can stand.  On the
other hand, he is frightfully sensitive and even affectionate; so that
he probably gets as much as he gives in the way of hurt feelings.
Youll excuse me rambling on like this about my son.
JOHNNY.  _[who has pulled himself together]_  You did it on purpose.
I wasnt quite myself:  I needed a moment to pull round:  thank you.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Not at all.  Is your father at home?
JOHNNY.  No:  he's opening one of his free libraries.  Thats another
nice little penny gone.  He's mad on reading.  He promised another
free library last week.  It's ruinous.  Itll hit you as well as me
when Bunny marries Hypatia.  When all Hypatia's money is thrown away
on libraries, where will Bunny come in?  Cant you stop him?
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  I'm afraid not.  Hes a perfect whirlwind.
Indefatigable at public work.  Wonderful man, I think.
JOHNNY.  Oh, public work!  He does too much of it.  It's really a sort
of laziness, getting away from your own serious business to amuse
yourself with other people's.  Mind:  I dont say there isnt another
side to it.  It has its value as an advertisement.  It makes useful
acquaintances and leads to valuable business connections.  But it
takes his mind off the main chance; and he overdoes it.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  The danger of public business is that it never ends.
A man may kill himself at it.
