
GUNNER.  _[oppressed and disconcerted, hardly knows how to get out of
the room]_  Yes, sir.  I-- _[He turns again, appealing to Tarleton]_
Maynt I have my mother's photographs back again?  _[Mrs Tarleton
pricks up her ears]._
TARLETON.  Eh?  What?  Oh, the photographs!  Yes, yes, yes:  take
them.  _[Gunner takes them from the table, and is creeping away, when
Mrs Tarleton puts out her hand and stops him]._
MRS TARLETON.  Whats this, John?  What were you doing with his
mother's photographs?
TARLETON.  Nothing, nothing.  Never mind, Chickabiddy:  it's all
right.
MRS TARLETON.  _[snatching the photographs from Gunner's irresolute
fingers, and recognizing them at a glance]_  Lucy Titmus!  Oh John,
John!
TARLETON.  _[grimly, to Gunner]_  Young man:  youre a fool; but youve
just put the lid on this job in a masterly manner.  I knew you would.
I told you all to let well alone.  You wouldnt; and now you must take
the consequences--or rather _I_ must take them.
MRS TARLETON.  _[to Gunner]_  Are you Lucy's son?
GUNNER.  Yes.
MRS TARLETON.  And why didnt you come to me?  I didnt turn my back on
your mother when she came to me in her trouble.  Didnt you know that?
GUNNER.  No.  She never talked to me about anything.
TARLETON.  How could she talk to her own son?  Shy, Summerhays, shy.
Parent and child.  Shy.  _[He sits down at the end of the writing
table nearest the sideboard like a man resigned to anything that fate
may have in store for him]._
MRS TARLETON.  Then how did you find out?
GUNNER.  From her papers after she died.
MRS TARLETON.  _[shocked]_  Is Lucy dead?  And I never knew!  _[With
an effusion of tenderness]_  And you here being treated like that,
poor orphan, with nobody to take your part!  Tear up that foolish
paper, child; and sit down and make friends with me.
JOHNNY.        |    Hallo, mother this is all very well, you know--
               |
PERCIVAL.      |    But may I point out, Mrs Tarleton, that--
               |
BENTLEY.       |    Do you mean that after what he said of--
               |
HYPATIA.       |    Oh, look here, mamma:  this is really--
MRS TARLETON.  Will you please speak one at a time?
_Silence._
PERCIVAL _[in a very gentlemanly manner]_  Will you allow me to remind
you, Mrs Tarleton, that this man has uttered a most serious and
disgraceful falsehood concerning Miss Tarleton and myself?
MRS TARLETON.  I dont believe a word of it.  If the poor lad was there
in the Turkish bath, who has a better right to say what was going on
here than he has?  You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Patsy; and so
ought you too, Mr Percival, for encouraging her.  _[Hypatia retreats
to the pavilion, and exchanges grimaces with Johnny, shamelessly
enjoying Percival's sudden reverse.  They know their mother]._
PERCIVAL.  _[gasping]_  Mrs Tarleton:  I give you my word of honor--
MRS TARLETON.  Oh, go along with you and your word of honor.  Do you
think I'm a fool?  I wonder you can look the lad in the face after
bullying him and making him sign those wicked lies; and all the time
you carrying on with my daughter before youd been half an hour in my
house.  Fie, for shame!
PERCIVAL.  Lord Summerhays:  I appeal to you.  Have I done the correct
thing or not?
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Youve done your best, Mr Percival.  But the correct
thing depends for its success on everybody playing the game very
strictly.  As a single-handed game, it's impossible.
BENTLEY.  _[suddenly breaking out lamentably]_  Joey:  have you taken
Hypatia away from me?
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  _[severely]_  Bentley!  Bentley!  Control yourself,
sir.
