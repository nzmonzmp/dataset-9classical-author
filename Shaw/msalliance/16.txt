
LINA.  Oh no.  It's too tame a business for that.  I went up for
family reasons.
TARLETON.  Eh?  What?  Family reasons?
MRS TARLETON.  I hope it wasnt to spite your mother?
PERCIVAL.  _[quickly]_  Or your husband?
LINA.  I'm not married.  And why should I want to spite my mother?
HYPATIA.  _[aside to Percival]_  That was clever of you, Mr Percival.
PERCIVAL.  What?
HYPATIA.  To find out.
TARLETON.  I'm in a difficulty.  I cant understand a lady going up in
an aeroplane for family reasons.  It's rude to be curious and ask
questions; but then it's inhuman to be indifferent, as if you didnt
care.
LINA.  I'll tell you with pleasure.  For the last hundred and fifty
years, not a single day has passed without some member of my family
risking his life--or her life.  It's a point of honor with us to keep
up that tradition.  Usually several of us do it; but it happens that
just at this moment it is being kept up by one of my brothers only.
Early this morning I got a telegram from him to say that there had
been a fire, and that he could do nothing for the rest of the week.
Fortunately I had an invitation from the Aerial League to see this
gentleman try to break the passenger record.  I appealed to the
President of the League to let me save the honor of my family.  He
arranged it for me.
TARLETON.  Oh, I must be dreaming.  This is stark raving nonsense.
LINA.  _[quietly]_  You are quite awake, sir.
JOHNNY.  We cant all be dreaming the same thing, Governor.
TARLETON.  Of course not, you duffer; but then I'm dreaming you as
well as the lady.
MRS TARLETON.  Dont be silly, John.  The lady is only joking, I'm
sure.  _[To Lina]_  I suppose your luggage is in the aeroplane.
PERCIVAL.  Luggage was out of the question.  If I stay to dinner I'm
afraid I cant change unless youll lend me some clothes.
MRS TARLETON.  Do you mean neither of you?
PERCIVAL.  I'm afraid so.
MRS TARLETON.  Oh well, never mind:  Hypatia will lend the lady a
gown.
LINA.  Thank you:  I'm quite comfortable as I am.  I am not accustomed
to gowns:  they hamper me and make me feel ridiculous; so if you dont
mind I shall not change.
MRS TARLETON.  Well, I'm beginning to think I'm doing a bit of
dreaming myself.
HYPATIA.  _[impatiently]_  Oh, it's all right, mamma.  Johnny:  look
after Mr. Percival.  _[To Lina, rising]_  Come with me.
_Lina follows her to the inner door.  They all rise._
JOHNNY.  _[to Percival]_  I'll shew you.
PERCIVAL.  Thank you.
