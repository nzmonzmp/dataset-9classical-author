
MRS TARLETON.  Oh, youve no sense, Johnny.  He calls his lunch his
dinner, and has his tea at half-past six.  Havnt you, dear?
GUNNER.  _[timidly]_  Hasnt everybody?
JOHNNY.  _[laughing]_  Well, by George, thats not bad.
MRS TARLETON.  Now dont be rude, Johnny:  you know I dont like it.
_[To Gunner]_  A cup of tea will pick you up.
GUNNER.  I'd rather not.  I'm all right.
TARLETON.  _[going to the sideboard]_  Here! try a mouthful of sloe
gin.
GUNNER.  No, thanks.  I'm a teetotaler.  I cant touch alcohol in any
form.
TARLETON.  Nonsense!  This isnt alcohol.  Sloe gin.  Vegetarian, you
know.
GUNNER.  _[hesitating]_  Is it a fruit beverage?
TARLETON.  Of course it is.  Fruit beverage.  Here you are.  _[He
gives him a glass of sloe gin]._
GUNNER.  _[going to the sideboard]_  Thanks.  _[he begins to drink it
confidently; but the first mouthful startles and almost chokes him]._
It's rather hot.
TARLETON.  Do you good.  Dont be afraid of it.
MRS TARLETON.  _[going to him]_  Sip it, dear.  Dont be in a hurry.
_Gunner sips slowly, each sip making his eyes water._
JOHNNY.  _[coming forward into the place left vacant by Gunner's visit
to the sideboard]_  Well, now that the gentleman has been attended to,
I should like to know where we are.  It may be a vulgar business
habit; but I confess I like to know where I am.
TARLETON.  I dont.  Wherever you are, youre there anyhow.  I tell you
again, leave it at that.
BENTLEY.  I want to know too.  Hypatia's engaged to me.
HYPATIA.  Bentley:  if you insult me again--if you say another word,
I'll leave the house and not enter it until you leave it.
JOHNNY.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it, my boy.
BENTLEY.  _[inarticulate with fury and suppressed tears]_  Oh!
Beasts!  Brutes!
MRS TARLETON.  Now dont hurt his feelings, poor little lamb!
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  _[very sternly]_  Bentley:  you are not behaving
well.  You had better leave us until you have recovered yourself.
_Bentley goes out in disgrace, but gets no further than half way to
the pavilion door, when, with a wild sob, he throws himself on the
floor and begins to yell._
MRS TARLETON.  |    _[running to him]_  Oh, poor child,
               |    poor child!  Dont cry, duckie:
               |    he didnt mean it:  dont cry.
               |
LORD SUMMERHAYS|    Stop that infernal noise, sir:  do you
               |    hear?  Stop it instantly.
               |
JOHNNY.        |    Thats the game he tried on me.
               |    There you are!  Now, mother!
               |    Now, Patsy!  You see for yourselves.
               |
HYPATIA.       |    _[covering her ears]_  Oh you little
               |    wretch!  Stop him, Mr Percival.  Kick him.
               |
TARLETON.      |    Steady on, steady on.  Easy, Bunny, easy.
LINA.  Leave him to me, Mrs Tarleton.  Stand clear, please.
