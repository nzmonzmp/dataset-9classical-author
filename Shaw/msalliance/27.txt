
THE MAN.  _[looking at Lina in amazement]_  Beaten by a female!  It
needed only this.  _[He collapses in the chair near the worktable, and
hides his face.  They cannot help pitying him]._
LINA.  Old pal:  dont call the police.  Lend him a bicycle and let him
get away.
THE MAN.  I cant ride a bicycle.  I never could afford one.  I'm not
even that much good.
TARLETON.  If I gave you a hundred pound note now to go and have a
good spree with, I wonder would you know how to set about it.  Do you
ever take a holiday?
THE MAN.  Take!  I got four days last August.
TARLETON.  What did you do?
THE MAN.  I did a cheap trip to Folkestone.  I spent sevenpence on
dropping pennies into silly automatic machines and peepshows of rowdy
girls having a jolly time.  I spent a penny on the lift and fourpence
on refreshments.  That cleaned me out.  The rest of the time I was so
miserable that I was glad to get back to the office.  Now you know.
LINA.  Come to the gymnasium:  I'll teach you how to make a man of
yourself.  _[The man is about to rise irresolutely, from the mere
habit of doing what he is told, when Tarleton stops him]._
TARLETON.  Young man:  dont.  Youve tried to shoot me; but I'm not
vindictive.  I draw the line at putting a man on the rack.  If you
want every joint in your body stretched until it's an agony to
live--until you have an unnatural feeling that all your muscles are
singing and laughing with pain--then go to the gymnasium with that
lady.  But youll be more comfortable in jail.
LINA.  _[greatly amused]_  Was that why you went away, old pal?  Was
that the telegram you said you had forgotten to send?
_Mrs Tarleton comes in hastily through the inner door._
MRS TARLETON.  _[on the steps]_  Is anything the matter, John?  Nurse
says she heard you calling me a quarter of an hour ago; and that your
voice sounded as if you were ill.  _[She comes between Tarleton and
the man.]_  Is anything the matter?
TARLETON.  This is the son of an old friend of mine.  Mr--er--Mr
Gunner.  _[To the man, who rises awkwardly]._  My wife.
MRS TARLETON.  Good evening to you.
GUNNER.  Er-- _[He is too nervous to speak, and makes a shambling
bow]._
_Bentley looks in at the pavilion door, very peevish, and too
preoccupied with his own affairs to pay any attention to those of the
company._
BENTLEY.  I say:  has anybody seen Hypatia?  She promised to come out
with me; and I cant find her anywhere.  And wheres Joey?
GUNNER.  _[suddenly breaking out aggressively, being incapable of any
middle way between submissiveness and violence]_  _I_ can tell you
where Hypatia is.  I can tell you where Joey is.  And I say it's a
scandal and an infamy.  If people only knew what goes on in this
so-called respectable house it would be put a stop to.  These are the
morals of our pious capitalist class!  This is your rotten
bourgeoisie!  This!--
MRS TARLETON.  Dont you dare use such language in company.  I wont
allow it.
TARLETON.  All right, Chickabiddy:  it's not bad language:  it's only
Socialism.
MRS TARLETON.  Well, I wont have any Socialism in my house.
TARLETON.  _[to Gunner]_  You hear what Mrs Tarleton says.  Well, in
this house everybody does what she says or out they go.
GUNNER.  Do you suppose I want to stay?  Do you think I would breathe
this polluted atmosphere a moment longer than I could help?
BENTLEY.  _[running forward between Lina and Gunner]_  But what did
you mean by what you said about Miss Tarleton and Mr Percival, you
beastly rotter, you?
GUNNER.  _[to Tarleton]_  Oh! is Hypatia your daughter?  And Joey is
Mister Percival, is he?  One of your set, I suppose.  One of the smart
set!  One of the bridge-playing, eighty-horse-power, week-ender set!
One of the johnnies I slave for!  Well, Joey has more decency than
your daughter, anyhow.  The women are the worst.  I never believed it
til I saw it with my own eyes.  Well, it wont last for ever.  The
writing is on the wall.  Rome fell.  Babylon fell.  Hindhead's turn
will come.
