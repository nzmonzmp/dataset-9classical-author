
PERCIVAL.  --and refraining from delivering me up to the punishment I
so richly deserve.
BENTLEY.  "richly deserve."
PERCIVAL.  _[to Hypatia]_  Does that satisfy you, Miss Tarleton?
HYPATIA.  Yes:  that will teach him to tell lies next time.
BENTLEY.  _[rising to make place for Gunner and handing him the pen]_
You mean it will teach him to tell the truth next time.
TARLETON.  Ahem!  Do you, Patsy?
PERCIVAL.  Be good enough to sign.  _[Gunner sits down helplessly and
dips the pen in the ink]._  I hope what you are signing is no mere
form of words to you, and that you not only say you are sorry, but
that you are sorry.
_Lord Summerhays and Johnny come in through the pavilion door._
MRS TARLETON.  Stop.  Mr Percival:  I think, on Hypatia's account,
Lord Summerhays ought to be told about this.
_Lord Summerhays, wondering what the matter is, comes forward between
Percival and Lina.  Johnny stops beside Hypatia._
PERCIVAL.  Certainly.
TARLETON.  _[uneasily]_  Take my advice, and cut it short.  Get rid of
him.
MRS TARLETON.  Hypatia ought to have her character cleared.
TARLETON.  You let well alone, Chickabiddy.  Most of our characters
will bear a little careful dusting; but they wont bear scouring.
Patsy is jolly well out of it.  What does it matter, anyhow?
PERCIVAL.  Mr Tarleton:  we have already said either too much or not
enough.  Lord Summerhays:  will you be kind enough to witness the
declaration this man has just signed?
GUNNER.  I havnt yet.  Am I to sign now?
PERCIVAL.  Of course.  _[Gunner, who is now incapable of doing
anything on his own initiative, signs]._  Now stand up and read your
declaration to this gentleman.  _[Gunner makes a vague movement and
looks stupidly round.  Percival adds peremptorily]_  Now, please.
GUNNER _[rising apprehensively and reading in a hardly audible voice,
like a very sick man]_  I, John Brown, of 4 Chesterfield Parade,
Kentish Town, do hereby voluntarily confess that on the 31st May 1909
I trespassed on the land of John Tarleton at Hindhead, and effected an
unlawful entry into his house, where I secreted myself in a portable
Turkish bath, with a pistol, with which I threatened to take the life
of the said John Tarleton, and was prevented from doing so only by the
timely arrival of the celebrated Miss Lena Sh-Sh-sheepanossika.  I
further confess that I was guilty of uttering an abominable calumny
concerning Miss Hypatia Tarleton, for which there was not a shred of
foundation.  I apologize most humbly to the lady and her family for my
conduct; and I promise Mr Tarleton not to repeat it, and to amend my
life, and to do what in me lies to prove worthy of his kindness in
giving me another chance and refraining from delivering me up to the
punishment I so richly deserve.
_A short and painful silence follows.  Then Percival speaks._
PERCIVAL.  Do you consider that sufficient, Lord Summerhays?
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Oh quite, quite.
PERCIVAL. _[to Hypatia]_  Lord Summerhays would probably like to hear
you say that you are satisfied, Miss Tarleton.
HYPATIA.  _[coming out of the swing, and advancing between Percival
and Lord Summerhays]_  I must say that you have behaved like a perfect
gentleman, Mr. Percival.
PERCIVAL.  _[first bowing to Hypatia, and then turning with cold
contempt to Gunner, who is standing helpless]_  We need not trouble
you any further.  _[Gunner turns vaguely towards the pavilion]._
JOHNNY _[with less refined offensiveness, pointing to the pavilion]_
Thats your way.  The gardener will shew you the shortest way into the
road.  Go the shortest way.
