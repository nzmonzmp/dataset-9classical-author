
PERCIVAL.  Oh! has Ben been talking about me?
TARLETON.  Consider yourself as one of the family--if you will do me
the honor.  And your friend too.  Wheres your friend?
PERCIVAL.  Oh, by the way! before he comes in:  let me explain.  I
dont know him.
TARLETON.  Eh?
PERCIVAL.  Havnt even looked at him.  I'm trying to make a club record
with a passenger.  The club supplied the passenger.  He just got in;
and Ive been too busy handling the aeroplane to look at him.  I havnt
said a word to him; and I cant answer for him socially; but hes an
ideal passenger for a flyer.  He saved me from a smash.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  I saw it.  It was extraordinary.  When you were
thrown out he held on to the top bar with one hand.  You came past him
in the air, going straight for the glass.  He caught you and turned
you off into the flower bed, and then lighted beside you like a bird.
PERCIVAL.  How he kept his head I cant imagine.  Frankly, _I_ didnt.
_The Passenger, also begoggled, comes in through the pavilion with
Johnny and the two ladies.  The Passenger comes between Percival and
Tarleton, Mrs Tarleton between Lord Summerhays and her husband,
Hypatia between Percival and Bentley, and Johnny to Bentley's right._
TARLETON.  Just discussing your prowess, my dear sir.  Magnificent.
Youll stay to dinner.  Youll stay the night.  Stay over the week.  The
Chickabiddy will be delighted.
MRS TARLETON.  Wont you take off your goggles and have some tea?
_The Passenger begins to remove the goggles._
TARLETON.  Do.  Have a wash.  Johnny:  take the gentleman to your
room:  I'll look after Mr Percival.  They must--
_By this time the passenger has got the goggles off, and stands
revealed as a remarkably good-looking woman._
MRS TARLETON.  |    Well I never!!!                         |
               |                                            |
BENTLEY.       |    [_in a whisper_] Oh, I say!             |
               |                                            |
JOHNNY.        |    By George!                              |

               |                                            | gether._
HYPATIA.       |    A woman!                                |
               |                                            |
TARLETON.      |    [_to Percival_] You never told me--     |
               |                                            |
PERCIVAL.      |    I hadnt the least idea--                |
_An embarrassed pause._
PERCIVAL.  I assure you if I'd had the faintest notion that my
passenger was a lady I shouldnt have left you to shift for yourself in
that selfish way.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  The lady seems to have shifted for both very
effectually, sir.
PERCIVAL.  Saved my life.  I admit it most gratefully.
TARLETON.  I must apologize, madam, for having offered you the
civilities appropriate to the opposite sex.  And yet, why opposite?
We are all human:  males and females of the same species.  When the
dress is the same the distinction vanishes.  I'm proud to receive in
my house a lady of evident refinement and distinction.  Allow me to
introduce myself:  Tarleton:  John Tarleton (_seeing conjecture in the
passenger's eye_)--yes, yes:  Tarleton's Underwear.  My wife, Mrs
Tarleton:  youll excuse me for having in what I had taken to be a
confidence between man and man alluded to her as the Chickabiddy.  My
daughter Hypatia, who has always wanted some adventure to drop out of
the sky, and is now, I hope, satisfied at last.  Lord Summerhays:  a
man known wherever the British flag waves.  His son Bentley, engaged
to Hypatia.  Mr Joseph Percival, the promising son of three highly
intellectual fathers.
HYPATIA.  _[startled]_  Bentley's friend?  _[Bentley nods]._
TARLETON.  _[continuing, to the passenger]_  May I now ask to be
allowed the pleasure of knowing your name?
THE PASSENGER.  My name is Lina Szczepanowska _[pronouncing it
Sh-Chepanovska]._
PERCIVAL.  Sh--  I beg your pardon?
LINA.  Szczepanowska.
PERCIVAL.  _[dubiously]_  Thank you.
