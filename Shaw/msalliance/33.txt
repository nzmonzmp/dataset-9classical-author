
TARLETON.  Come, Mr Percival! the shutters are up on the gentlemanly
business.  Try the truth.
PERCIVAL.  I am in a wretched position.  If I tell the truth nobody
will believe me.
TARLETON.  Oh yes they will.  The truth makes everybody believe it.
PERCIVAL.  It also makes everybody pretend not to believe it.  Mrs
Tarleton:  youre not playing the game.
MRS TARLETON.  I dont think youve behaved at all nicely, Mr Percival.
BENTLEY.  I wouldnt have played you such a dirty trick, Joey.
_[Struggling with a sob]_  You beast.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Bentley:  you must control yourself.  Let me say at
the same time, Mr Percival, that my son seems to have been mistaken in
regarding you either as his friend or as a gentleman.
PERCIVAL.  Miss Tarleton:  I'm suffering this for your sake.  I ask
you just to say that I am not to blame.  Just that and nothing more.
HYPATIA.  _[gloating mischievously over his distress]_  You chased me
through the heather and kissed me.  You shouldnt have done that if you
were not in earnest.
PERCIVAL.  Oh, this is really the limit.  _[Turning desperately to
Gunner]_  Sir:  I appeal to you.  As a gentleman! as a man of honor!
as a man bound to stand by another man!  You were in that Turkish
bath.  You saw how it began.  Could any man have behaved more
correctly than I did?  Is there a shadow of foundation for the
accusations brought against me?
GUNNER.  _[sorely perplexed]_  Well, what do you want me to say?
JOHNNY.  He has said what he had to say already, hasnt he?  Read that
paper.
GUNNER.  When I tell the truth, you make me go back on it.  And now
you want me to go back on myself!  What is a man to do?
PERCIVAL.  _[patiently]_  Please try to get your mind clear, Mr Brown.
I pointed out to you that you could not, as a gentleman, disparage a
lady's character.  You agree with me, I hope.
GUNNER.  Yes:  that sounds all right.
PERCIVAL.  But youre also bound to tell the truth.  Surely youll not
deny that.
GUNNER.  Who's denying it?  I say nothing against it.
PERCIVAL.  Of course not.  Well, I ask you to tell the truth simply
and unaffectedly.  Did you witness any improper conduct on my part
when you were in the bath?
GUNNER.  No, sir.
JOHNNY.        |    Then what do you mean by saying that--
               |
HYPATIA.       |    Do you mean to say that I--
               |
BENTLEY.       |    Oh, you are a rotter.  Youre afraid--
TARLETON.  _[rising]_  Stop.  _[Silence]._  Leave it at that.  Enough
said.  You keep quiet, Johnny.  Mr Percival:  youre whitewashed.  So
are you, Patsy.  Honors are easy.  Lets drop the subject.  The next
thing to do is to open a subscription to start this young man on a
ranch in some far country thats accustomed to be in a disturbed state.
He--
MRS TARLETON.  Now stop joking the poor lad, John:  I wont have it.
Has been worried to death between you all.  _[To Gunner]_  Have you
had your tea?
GUNNER.  Tea?  No:  it's too early.  I'm all right; only I had no
dinner:  I didnt think I'd want it.  I didnt think I'd be alive.
MRS TARLETON.  Oh, what a thing to say!  You mustnt talk like that.
JOHNNY.  Hes out of his mind.  He thinks it's past dinner-time.
