
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Is that the usual form of test in your profession?
LINA.  Nothing that we Szczepanowskis do is usual, my lord.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Are you all so wonderful?
LINA.  It is our profession to be wonderful.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Do you never condescend to do as common people do?
For instance, do you not pray as common people pray?
LINA.  Common people do not pray, my lord:  they only beg.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  You never ask for anything?
LINA.  No.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Then why do you pray?
LINA.  To remind myself that I have a soul.
TARLETON.  _[walking about]_  True.  Fine.  Good.  Beautiful.  All
this damned materialism:  what good is it to anybody?  Ive got a soul:
dont tell me I havnt.  Cut me up and you cant find it.  Cut up a steam
engine and you cant find the steam.  But, by George, it makes the
engine go.  Say what you will, Summerhays, the divine spark is a fact.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Have I denied it?
TARLETON.  Our whole civilization is a denial of it.  Read Walt
Whitman.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  I shall go to the billiard room and get the balls
for you.
LINA.  Thank you.
_Lord Summerhays goes out through the vestibule door._
TARLETON.  _[going to her]_  Listen to me.  _[She turns quickly]._
What you said just now was beautiful.  You touch chords.  You appeal
to the poetry in a man.  You inspire him.  Come now!  Youre a woman of
the world:  youre independent:  you must have driven lots of men
crazy.  You know the sort of man I am, dont you?  See through me at a
glance, eh?
LINA.  Yes.  _[She sits down quietly in the chair Lord Summerhays has
just left]._
TARLETON.  Good.  Well, do you like me?  Dont misunderstand me:  I'm
perfectly aware that youre not going to fall in love at first sight
with a ridiculous old shopkeeper.  I cant help that ridiculous old
shopkeeper.  I have to carry him about with me whether I like it or
not.  I have to pay for his clothes, though I hate the cut of them:
especially the waistcoat.  I have to look at him in the glass while
I'm shaving.  I loathe him because hes a living lie.  My soul's not
like that:  it's like yours.  I want to make a fool of myself.  About
you.  Will you let me?
LINA.  _[very calm]_  How much will you pay?
TARLETON.  Nothing.  But I'll throw as many sovereigns as you like
into the sea to shew you that I'm in earnest.
LINA.  Are those your usual terms?
TARLETON.  No.  I never made that bid before.
LINA.  _[producing a dainty little book and preparing to write in it]_
What did you say your name was?
TARLETON.  John Tarleton.  The great John Tarleton of Tarleton's
Underwear.
