
LINA.  _[writing]_  T-a-r-l-e-t-o-n.  Er--?  _[She looks up at him
inquiringly]._
TARLETON.  _[promptly]_  Fifty-eight.
LINA.  Thank you.  I keep a list of all my offers.  I like to know
what I'm considered worth.
TARLETON.  Let me look.
LINA.  _[offering the book to him]_  It's in Polish.
TARLETON.  Thats no good.  Is mine the lowest offer?
LINA.  No:  the highest.
TARLETON.  What do most of them come to?  Diamonds?  Motor cars?
Furs?  Villa at Monte Carlo?
LINA.  Oh yes:  all that.  And sometimes the devotion of a lifetime.
TARLETON.  Fancy that!  A young man offering a woman his old age as a
temptation!
LINA.  By the way, you did not say how long.
TARLETON.  Until you get tired of me.
LINA.  Or until you get tired of me?
TARLETON.  I never get tired.  I never go on long enough for that.
But when it becomes so grand, so inspiring that I feel that everything
must be an anti-climax after that, then I run away.
LINA.  Does she let you go without a struggle?
TARLETON.  Yes.  Glad to get rid of me.  When love takes a man as it
takes me--when it makes him great--it frightens a woman.
LINA.  The lady here is your wife, isnt she?  Dont you care for her?
TARLETON.  Yes.  And mind! she comes first always.  I reserve her
dignity even when I sacrifice my own.  Youll respect that point of
honor, wont you?
LINA.  Only a point of honor?
TARLETON.  _[impulsively]_  No, by God! a point of affection as well.
LINA.  _[smiling, pleased with him]_  Shake hands, old pal _[she rises
and offers him her hand frankly]._
TARLETON.  _[giving his hand rather dolefully]_  Thanks.  That means
no, doesnt it?
LINA.  It means something that will last longer than yes.  I like you.
I admit you to my friendship.  What a pity you were not trained when
you were young!  Youd be young still.
TARLETON.  I suppose, to an athlete like you, I'm pretty awful, eh?
LINA.  Shocking.
