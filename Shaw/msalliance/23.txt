
PERCIVAL.  Of course if youre going to insult me, I am quite helpless.
Youre a woman:  you can say what you like.
HYPATIA.  And you can only say what you dare.  Poor wretch:  it isnt
much.  _[He bites his lip, and sits down, very much annoyed]._
Really, Mr Percival!  You sit down in the presence of a lady and leave
her standing.  _[He rises hastily]._  Ha, ha!  Really, Mr Percival!
Oh really, really, really, really, really, Mr Percival!  How do you
like it?  Wouldnt you rather I damned you?
PERCIVAL.  Miss Tarleton--
HYPATIA.  _[caressingly]_  Hypatia, Joey. Patsy, if you like.
PERCIVAL.  Look here:  this is no good.  You want to do what you like?
HYPATIA.  Dont you?
PERCIVAL.  No.  Ive been too well brought up.  Ive argued all through
this thing; and I tell you I'm not prepared to cast off the social
bond.  It's like a corset:  it's a support to the figure even if it
does squeeze and deform it a bit.  I want to be free.
HYPATIA.  Well, I'm tempting you to be free.
PERCIVAL.  Not at all.  Freedom, my good girl, means being able to
count on how other people will behave.  If every man who dislikes me
is to throw a handful of mud in my face, and every woman who likes me
is to behave like Potiphar's wife, then I shall be a slave:  the slave
of uncertainty:  the slave of fear:  the worst of all slaveries.  How
would you like it if every laborer you met in the road were to make
love to you?  No.  Give me the blessed protection of a good stiff
conventionality among thoroughly well-brought up ladies and gentlemen.
HYPATIA.  Another talker!  Men like conventions because men made them.
I didnt make them:  I dont like them:  I wont keep them.  Now, what
will you do?
PERCIVAL.  Bolt.  _[He runs out through the pavilion]._
HYPATIA.  I'll catch you.  _[She dashes off in pursuit]._
_During this conversation the head of the scandalized man in the
Turkish bath has repeatedly risen from the lunette, with a strong
expression of moral shock.  It vanishes abruptly as the two turn
towards it in their flight.  At the same moment Tarleton comes back
through the vestibule door, exhausted by severe and unaccustomed
exercise._
TARLETON.  _[looking after the flying figures with amazement]_  Hallo,
Patsy:  whats up?  Another aeroplane?  _[They are far too preoccupied
to hear him; and he is left staring after them as they rush away
through the garden.  He goes to the pavilion door and looks up; but
the heavens are empty.  His exhaustion disables him from further
inquiry.  He dabs his brow with his handkerchief, and walks stiffly to
the nearest convenient support, which happens to be the Turkish bath.
He props himself upon it with his elbow, and covers his eyes with his
hand for a moment.  After a few sighing breaths, he feels a little
better, and uncovers his eyes.  The man's head rises from the lunette
a few inches from his nose.  He recoils from the bath with a violent
start]._  Oh Lord!  My brain's gone.  _[Calling piteously]_
Chickabiddy!  _[He staggers down to the writing table]._
THE MAN.  _[coming out of the bath, pistol in hand]_  Another sound;
and youre a dead man.
TARLETON.  _[braced]_  Am I?  Well, youre a live one:  thats one
comfort.  I thought you were a ghost.  _[He sits down, quite
undisturbed by the pistol]_  Who are you; and what the devil were you
doing in my new Turkish bath?
THE MAN.  _[with tragic intensity]_  I am the son of Lucinda Titmus.
TARLETON.  _[the name conveying nothing to him]_  Indeed?  And how is
she?  Quite well, I hope, eh?
THE MAN.  She is dead.  Dead, my God! and youre alive.
TARLETON.  _[unimpressed by the tragedy, but sympathetic]_  Oh!  Lost
your mother?  Thats sad.  I'm sorry.  But we cant all have the luck to
survive our mothers, and be nursed out of the world by the hands that
nursed us into it.
THE MAN.  Much you care, damn you!
TARLETON.  Oh, dont cut up rough.  Face it like a man.  You see I
didnt know your mother; but Ive no doubt she was an excellent woman.
THE MAN.  Not know her!  Do you dare to stand there by her open grave
and deny that you knew her?
TARLETON.  _[trying to recollect]_  What did you say her name was?
THE MAN.  Lucinda Titmus.
