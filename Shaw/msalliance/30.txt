
BENTLEY.  Shew us a letter addressed to you.
GUNNER.  How can I?  I never get any letters:  I'm only a clerk.  I
can shew you J. B. on my handkerchief.  _[He takes out a not very
clean one]._
BENTLEY.  _[with disgust]_  Oh, put it up again.  Let it go at John
Brown.
PERCIVAL.  Where do you live?
GUNNER.  4 Chesterfield Parade, Kentish Town, N.W.
PERCIVAL.  _[dictating]_  I, John Brown, of 4 Chesterfield Parade,
Kentish Town, do hereby voluntarily confess that on the 31st May 1909
I-- _[To Tarleton]_  What did he do exactly?
TARLETON.  _[dictating]_  --I trespassed on the land of John Tarleton
at Hindhead, and effected an unlawful entry into his house, where I
secreted myself in a portable Turkish bath--
BENTLEY.  Go slow, old man.  Just a moment.  "Turkish bath"--yes?
TARLETON.  _[continuing]_  --with a pistol, with which I threatened to
take the life of the said John Tarleton--
MRS TARLETON.  Oh, John!  You might have been killed.
TARLETON.  --and was prevented from doing so only by the timely
arrival of the celebrated Miss Lina Szczepanowska.
MRS TARLETON.  Is she celebrated?  _[Apologetically]_  I never
dreamt--
BENTLEY.  Look here:  I'm awfully sorry; but I cant spell
Szczepanowska.
PERCIVAL.  I think it's S, z, c, z-- _[Lina gives him her
visiting-card]._  Thank you.  _[He throws it on Bentley's blotter]._
BENTLEY.  Thanks awfully.  _[He writes the name]._
TARLETON.  _[to Percival]_  Now it's your turn.
PERCIVAL.  _[dictating]_  I further confess that I was guilty of
uttering an abominable calumny concerning Miss Hypatia Tarleton, for
which there was not a shred of foundation.
_Impressive silence whilst Bentley writes._
BENTLEY.  "foundation"?
PERCIVAL.  I apologize most humbly to the lady and her family for my
conduct--  _[he waits for Bentley to write]._
BENTLEY.  "conduct"?
PERCIVAL.  --and I promise Mr Tarleton not to repeat it, and to amend
my life--
BENTLEY.  "amend my life"?
PERCIVAL.  --and to do what in me lies to prove worthy of his kindness
in giving me another chance--
BENTLEY.  "another chance"?
