
MRS TARLETON.  A Bible and six oranges.
TARLETON.  I understand the oranges:  shes doing an orange cure of
some sort.  But what on earth does she want the Bible for?
MRS TARLETON.  I'm sure I cant imagine.  She cant be right in her
head.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Perhaps she wants to read it.
MRS TARLETON.  But why should she, on a weekday, at all events.  What
would you advise me to do, Lord Summerhays?
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Well, is there a Bible in the house?
TARLETON.  Stacks of em.  Theres the family Bible, and the Dore Bible,
and the parallel revised version Bible, and the Doves Press Bible, and
Johnny's Bible and Bobby's Bible and Patsy's Bible, and the
Chickabiddy's Bible and my Bible; and I daresay the servants could
raise a few more between them.  Let her have the lot.
MRS TARLETON.  Dont talk like that before Lord Summerhays, John.
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  It doesnt matter, Mrs Tarleton:  in Jinghiskahn it
was a punishable offence to expose a Bible for sale.  The empire has
no religion.
_Lina comes in.  She has left her cap in Hypatia's room.  She stops on
the landing just inside the door, and speaks over the handrail._
LINA.  Oh, Mrs Tarleton, shall I be making myself very troublesome if
I ask for a music-stand in my room as well?
TARLETON.  Not at all. You can have the piano if you like.  Or the
gramophone.  Have the gramophone.
LINA.  No, thank you:  no music.
MRS TARLETON.  _[going to the steps]_  Do you think it's good for you
to eat so many oranges?  Arnt you afraid of getting jaundice?
LINA.  _[coming down]_  Not in the least.  But billiard balls will do
quite as well.
MRS TARLETON.  But you cant eat billiard balls, child!
TARLETON.  Get em, Chickabiddy.  I understand.  _[He imitates a
juggler tossing up balls]._  Eh?
LINA.  _[going to him, past his wife]_  Just so.
TARLETON.  Billiard balls and cues.  Plates, knives, and forks.  Two
paraffin lamps and a hatstand.
LINA.  No:  that is popular low-class business.  In our family we
touch nothing but classical work.  Anybody can do lamps and hatstands.
_I_ can do silver bullets.  That is really hard.  _[She passes on to
Lord Summerhays, and looks gravely down at him as he sits by the
writing table]._
MRS TARLETON.  Well, I'm sure I dont know what youre talking about;
and I only hope you know yourselves.  However, you shall have what you
want, of course.  _[She goes up the steps and leaves the room]._
LORD SUMMERHAYS.  Will you forgive my curiosity?  What is the Bible
for?
LINA.  To quiet my soul.
LORD SUMMERHAYS _[with a sigh]_  Ah yes, yes.  It no longer quiets
mine, I am sorry to say.
LINA.  That is because you do not know how to read it.  Put it up
before you on a stand; and open it at the Psalms.  When you can read
them and understand them, quite quietly and happily, and keep six
balls in the air all the time, you are in perfect condition; and youll
never make a mistake that evening.  If you find you cant do that, then
go and pray until you can.  And be very careful that evening.
