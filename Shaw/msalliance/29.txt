
TARLETON.  Gunner:  will you go to Paris for a fortnight?  I'll pay
your expenses.
HYPATIA.  What do you mean?
GUNNER.  There was a silent witness in the Turkish bath.
TARLETON.  I found him hiding there.  Whatever went on here, he saw
and heard.  Thats what he means.
PERCIVAL.  _[sternly approaching Gunner, and speaking with deep but
contained indignation]_  Am I to understand you as daring to put
forward the monstrous and blackguardly lie that this lady behaved
improperly in my presence?
GUNNER.  _[turning white]_  You know what I saw and heard.
_Hypatia, with a gleam of triumph in her eyes, slips noiselessly into
the swing chair, and watches Percival and Gunner, swinging slightly,
but otherwise motionless._
PERCIVAL.  I hope it is not necessary for me to assure you all that
there is not one word of truth--not one grain of substance--in this
rascally calumny, which no man with a spark of decent feeling would
have uttered even if he had been ignorant enough to believe it.  Miss
Tarleton's conduct, since I have had the honor of knowing her, has
been, I need hardly say, in every respect beyond reproach.  _[To
Gunner]_  As for you, sir, youll have the goodness to come out with me
immediately.  I have some business with you which cant be settled in
Mrs Tarleton's presence or in her house.
GUNNER.  _[painfully frightened]_  Why should I go out with you?
PERCIVAL.  Because I intend that you shall.
GUNNER.  I wont be bullied by you.  _[Percival makes a threatening
step towards him]._  Police!  _[He tries to bolt; but Percival seizes
him]._  Leave me go, will you?  What right have you to lay hands on
me?
TARLETON.  Let him run for it, Mr Percival.  Hes very poor company.
We shall be well rid of him.  Let him go.
PERCIVAL.  Not until he has taken back and made the fullest apology
for the abominable lie he has told.  He shall do that or he shall
defend himself as best he can against the most thorough thrashing I'm
capable of giving him.  _[Releasing Gunner, but facing him ominously]_
Take your choice.  Which is it to be?
GUNNER.  Give me a fair chance.  Go and stick at a desk from nine to
six for a month, and let me have your grub and your sport and your
lessons in boxing, and I'll fight you fast enough.  You know I'm no
good or you darent bully me like this.
PERCIVAL.  You should have thought of that before you attacked a lady
with a dastardly slander.  I'm waiting for your decision.  I'm rather
in a hurry, please.
GUNNER.  I never said anything against the lady.
MRS TARLETON.  |    Oh, listen to that!
               |
BENTLEY.       |    What a liar!
               |
HYPATIA.       |    Oh!
               |
TARLETON.      |    Oh, come!
PERCIVAL.  We'll have it in writing, if you dont mind.  _[Pointing to
the writing table]_  Sit down; and take that pen in your hand.
_[Gunner looks irresolutely a little way round; then obeys]._  Now
write.  "I," whatever your name is--
GUNNER _[after a vain attempt]_  I cant.  My hand's shaking too much.
You see it's no use.  I'm doing my best.  I cant.
PERCIVAL.  Mr Summerhays will write it:  you can sign it.
BENTLEY.  _[insolently to Gunner]_  Get up. _[Gunner obeys; and
Bentley, shouldering him aside towards Percival, takes his place and
prepares to write]._
PERCIVAL.  Whats your name?
GUNNER.  John Brown.
TARLETON.  Oh come!  Couldnt you make it Horace Smith? or Algernon
Robinson?
GUNNER.  _[agitatedly]_  But my name is John Brown.  There are really
John Browns.  How can I help it if my name's a common one?
