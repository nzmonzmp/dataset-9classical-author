
LIZA. If I was doing it proper, what was you laughing at? [To
Higgins] Have I said anything I oughtn't?
MRS. HIGGINS [interposing] Not at all, Miss Doolittle.
LIZA. Well, that's a mercy, anyhow. [Expansively] What I always
say is--
HIGGINS [rising and looking at his watch] Ahem!
LIZA [looking round at him; taking the hint; and rising] Well: I
must go. [They all rise. Freddy goes to the door]. So pleased to
have met you. Good-bye. [She shakes hands with Mrs. Higgins].
MRS. HIGGINS. Good-bye.
LIZA. Good-bye, Colonel Pickering.
PICKERING. Good-bye, Miss Doolittle. [They shake hands].
LIZA [nodding to the others] Good-bye, all.
FREDDY [opening the door for her] Are you walking across the
Park, Miss Doolittle? If so--
LIZA. Walk! Not bloody likely. [Sensation]. I am going in a taxi.
[She goes out].
Pickering gasps and sits down. Freddy goes out on the balcony to
catch another glimpse of Eliza.
MRS. EYNSFORD HILL [suffering from shock] Well, I really can't
get used to the new ways.
CLARA [throwing herself discontentedly into the Elizabethan
chair]. Oh, it's all right, mamma, quite right. People will think
we never go anywhere or see anybody if you are so old-fashioned.
MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. I daresay I am very old-fashioned; but I do
hope you won't begin using that expression, Clara. I have got
accustomed to hear you talking about men as rotters, and calling
everything filthy and beastly; though I do think it horrible and
unladylike. But this last is really too much. Don't you think so,
Colonel Pickering?
PICKERING. Don't ask me. I've been away in India for several
years; and manners have changed so much that I sometimes don't
know whether I'm at a respectable dinner-table or in a ship's
forecastle.
CLARA. It's all a matter of habit. There's no right or wrong in
it. Nobody means anything by it. And it's so quaint, and gives
such a smart emphasis to things that are not in themselves very
witty. I find the new small talk delightful and quite innocent.
MRS. EYNSFORD HILL [rising] Well, after that, I think it's time
for us to go.
Pickering and Higgins rise.
CLARA [rising] Oh yes: we have three at homes to go to still.
Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins. Good-bye, Colonel Pickering. Good-bye,
Professor Higgins.
HIGGINS [coming grimly at her from the divan, and accompanying
her to the door] Good-bye. Be sure you try on that small talk at
the three at-homes. Don't be nervous about it. Pitch it in
strong.
CLARA [all smiles] I will. Good-bye. Such nonsense, all this
early Victorian prudery!
HIGGINS [tempting her] Such damned nonsense!
CLARA. Such bloody nonsense!
MRS. EYNSFORD HILL [convulsively] Clara!
