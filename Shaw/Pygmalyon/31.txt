
LIZA. He might want them for the next girl you pick up to
experiment on.
HIGGINS [shocked and hurt] Is THAT the way you feel towards us?
LIZA. I don't want to hear anything more about that. All I want
to know is whether anything belongs to me. My own clothes were
burnt.
HIGGINS. But what does it matter? Why need you start bothering
about that in the middle of the night?
LIZA. I want to know what I may take away with me. I don't want
to be accused of stealing.
HIGGINS [now deeply wounded] Stealing! You shouldn't have said
that, Eliza. That shows a want of feeling.
LIZA. I'm sorry. I'm only a common ignorant girl; and in my
station I have to be careful. There can't be any feelings between
the like of you and the like of me. Please will you tell me what
belongs to me and what doesn't?
HIGGINS [very sulky] You may take the whole damned houseful if
you like. Except the jewels. They're hired. Will that satisfy
you? [He turns on his heel and is about to go in extreme
dudgeon].
LIZA [drinking in his emotion like nectar, and nagging him to
provoke a further supply] Stop, please. [She takes off her
jewels]. Will you take these to your room and keep them safe? I
don't want to run the risk of their being missing.
HIGGINS [furious] Hand them over. [She puts them into his hands].
If these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler, I'd ram them
down your ungrateful throat. [He perfunctorily thrusts them into
his pockets, unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding
ends of the chains].
LIZA [taking a ring off] This ring isn't the jeweler's: it's the
one you bought me in Brighton. I don't want it now. [Higgins
dashes the ring violently into the fireplace, and turns on her so
threateningly that she crouches over the piano with her hands
over her face, and exclaims] Don't you hit me.
HIGGINS. Hit you! You infamous creature, how dare you accuse me
of such a thing? It is you who have hit me. You have wounded me
to the heart.
LIZA [thrilling with hidden joy] I'm glad. I've got a little of
my own back, anyhow.
HIGGINS [with dignity, in his finest professional style] You have
caused me to lose my temper: a thing that has hardly ever happend
to me before. I prefer to say nothing more tonight. I am going to
bed.
LIZA [pertly] You'd better leave a note for Mrs. Pearce about the
coffee; for she won't be told by me.
HIGGINS [formally] Damn Mrs. Pearce; and damn the coffee; and
damn you; and damn my own folly in having lavished MY hard-earned
knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a
heartless guttersnipe. [He goes out with impressive decorum, and
spoils it by slamming the door savagely].
Eliza smiles for the first time; expresses her feelings by a wild
pantomime in which an imitation of Higgins's exit is confused
with her own triumph; and finally goes down on her knees on the
hearthrug to look for the ring.
ACT V
Mrs. Higgins's drawing-room. She is at her writing-table as
before. The parlor-maid comes in.
THE PARLOR-MAID [at the door]  Mr. Henry, mam, is downstairs with
Colonel Pickering.
MRS. HIGGINS. Well, show them up.
THE PARLOR-MAID. They're using the telephone, mam. Telephoning to
the police, I think.
