
PICKERING. I think I shall turn in too. Still, it's been a great
occasion: a triumph for you. Good-night. [He goes].
HIGGINS [following him] Good-night. [Over his shoulder, at the
door] Put out the lights, Eliza; and tell Mrs. Pearce not to make
coffee for me in the morning: I'll take tea. [He goes out].
Eliza tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she rises
and walks across to the hearth to switch off the lights. By the
time she gets there she is on the point of screaming. She sits
down in Higgins's chair and holds on hard to the arms. Finally
she gives way and flings herself furiously on the floor raging.
HIGGINS [in despairing wrath outside] What the devil have I done
with my slippers? [He appears at the door].
LIZA [snatching up the slippers, and hurling them at him one
after the other with all her force] There are your slippers. And
there. Take your slippers; and may you never have a day's luck
with them!
HIGGINS [astounded] What on earth--! [He comes to her]. What's
the matter? Get up. [He pulls her up]. Anything wrong?
LIZA [breathless] Nothing wrong--with YOU. I've won your bet for
you, haven't I? That's enough for you. _I_ don't matter, I
suppose.
HIGGINS. YOU won my bet! You! Presumptuous insect! _I_ won it.
What did you throw those slippers at me for?
LIZA. Because I wanted to smash your face. I'd like to kill you,
you selfish brute. Why didn't you leave me where you picked me
out of--in the gutter? You thank God it's all over, and that now
you can throw me back again there, do you? [She crisps her
fingers, frantically].
HIGGINS [looking at her in cool wonder] The creature IS nervous,
after all.
LIZA [gives a suffocated scream of fury, and instinctively darts
her nails at his face]!!
HIGGINS [catching her wrists] Ah! would you? Claws in, you cat.
How dare you show your temper to me? Sit down and be quiet. [He
throws her roughly into the easy-chair].
LIZA [crushed by superior strength and weight] What's to become
of me? What's to become of me?
HIGGINS. How the devil do I know what's to become of you? What
does it matter what becomes of you?
LIZA. You don't care. I know you don't care. You wouldn't care if
I was dead. I'm nothing to you--not so much as them slippers.
HIGGINS [thundering] THOSE slippers.
LIZA [with bitter submission] Those slippers. I didn't think it
made any difference now.
A pause. Eliza hopeless and crushed. Higgins a little uneasy.
HIGGINS [in his loftiest manner] Why have you begun going on like
this? May I ask whether you complain of your treatment here?
LIZA. No.
HIGGINS. Has anybody behaved badly to you? Colonel Pickering?
Mrs. Pearce? Any of the servants?
LIZA. No.
HIGGINS. I presume you don't pretend that I have treated you
badly.
LIZA. No.
HIGGINS. I am glad to hear it. [He moderates his tone]. Perhaps
you're tired after the strain of the day. Will you have a glass
of champagne? [He moves towards the door].
