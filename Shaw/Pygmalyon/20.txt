
HIGGINS [rising and coming to her to coax her] Oh, that'll be all
right. I've taught her to speak properly; and she has strict
orders as to her behavior. She's to keep to two subjects: the
weather and everybody's health--Fine day and How do you do, you
know--and not to let herself go on things in general. That will
be safe.
MRS. HIGGINS. Safe! To talk about our health! about our insides!
perhaps about our outsides! How could you be so silly, Henry?
HIGGINS [impatiently] Well, she must talk about something. [He
controls himself and sits down again]. Oh, she'll be all right:
don't you fuss. Pickering is in it with me. I've a sort of bet on
that I'll pass her off as a duchess in six months. I started on
her some months ago; and she's getting on like a house on fire. I
shall win my bet. She has a quick ear; and she's been easier to
teach than my middle-class pupils because she's had to learn a
complete new language. She talks English almost as you talk
French.
MRS. HIGGINS. That's satisfactory, at all events.
HIGGINS. Well, it is and it isn't.
MRS. HIGGINS. What does that mean?
HIGGINS. You see, I've got her pronunciation all right; but you
have to consider not only how a girl pronounces, but what she
pronounces; and that's where--
They are interrupted by the parlor-maid, announcing guests.
THE PARLOR-MAID. Mrs. and Miss Eynsford Hill. [She withdraws].
HIGGINS. Oh Lord! [He rises; snatches his hat from the table; and
makes for the door; but before he reaches it his mother
introduces him].
Mrs. and Miss Eynsford Hill are the mother and daughter who
sheltered from the rain in Covent Garden. The mother is well
bred, quiet, and has the habitual anxiety of straitened means.
The daughter has acquired a gay air of being very much at home in
society: the bravado of genteel poverty.
MRS. EYNSFORD HILL [to Mrs. Higgins] How do you do? [They shake
hands].
Miss EYNSFORD HILL. How d'you do? [She shakes].
MRS. HIGGINS [introducing] My son Henry.
MRS. EYNSFORD HILL. Your celebrated son! I have so longed to meet
you, Professor Higgins.
HIGGINS [glumly, making no movement in her direction] Delighted.
[He backs against the piano and bows brusquely].
Miss EYNSFORD HILL [going to him with confident familiarity] How
do you do?
HIGGINS [staring at her] I've seen you before somewhere. I
haven't the ghost of a notion where; but I've heard your voice.
[Drearily] It doesn't matter. You'd better sit down.
MRS. HIGGINS. I'm sorry to say that my celebrated son has no
manners. You mustn't mind him.
MISS EYNSFORD HILL [gaily] I don't. [She sits in the Elizabethan
chair].
MRS. EYNSFORD HILL [a little bewildered] Not at all. [She sits on
the ottoman between her daughter and Mrs. Higgins, who has turned
her chair away from the writing-table].
HIGGINS. Oh, have I been rude? I didn't mean to be. He goes to
the central window, through which, with his back to the company,
he contemplates the river and the flowers in Battersea Park on
the opposite bank as if they were a frozen dessert.
The parlor-maid returns, ushering in Pickering.
THE PARLOR-MAID. Colonel Pickering [She withdraws].
PICKERING. How do you do, Mrs. Higgins?
