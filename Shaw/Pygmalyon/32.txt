
MRS. HIGGINS. What!
THE PARLOR-MAID [coming further in and lowering her voice] Mr.
Henry's in a state, mam. I thought I'd better tell you.
MRS. HIGGINS. If you had told me that Mr. Henry was not in a
state it would have been more surprising. Tell them to come up
when they've finished with the police. I suppose he's lost
something.
THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, mam [going].
MRS. HIGGINS. Go upstairs and tell Miss Doolittle that Mr. Henry
and the Colonel are here. Ask her not to come down till I send
for her.
THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, mam.
Higgins bursts in. He is, as the parlor-maid has said, in a
state.
HIGGINS. Look here, mother: here's a confounded thing!
MRS. HIGGINS. Yes, dear. Good-morning. [He checks his impatience
and kisses her, whilst the parlor-maid goes out]. What is it?
HIGGINS. Eliza's bolted.
MRS. HIGGINS [calmly continuing her writing] You must have
frightened her.
HIGGINS. Frightened her! nonsense! She was left last night, as
usual, to turn out the lights and all that; and instead of going
to bed she changed her clothes and went right off: her bed wasn't
slept in. She came in a cab for her things before seven this
morning; and that fool Mrs. Pearce let her have them without
telling me a word about it. What am I to do?
MRS. HIGGINS. Do without, I'm afraid, Henry. The girl has a
perfect right to leave if she chooses.
HIGGINS [wandering distractedly across the room] But I can't find
anything. I don't know what appointments I've got. I'm--
[Pickering comes in. Mrs. Higgins puts down her pen and turns
away from the writing-table].
PICKERING [shaking hands] Good-morning, Mrs. Higgins. Has Henry
told you? [He sits down on the ottoman].
HIGGINS. What does that ass of an inspector say? Have you offered
a reward?
MRS. HIGGINS [rising in indignant amazement] You don't mean to
say you have set the police after Eliza?
HIGGINS. Of course. What are the police for? What else could we
do? [He sits in the Elizabethan chair].
PICKERING. The inspector made a lot of difficulties. I really
think he suspected us of some improper purpose.
MRS. HIGGINS. Well, of course he did. What right have you to go
to the police and give the girl's name as if she were a thief, or
a lost umbrella, or something? Really! [She sits down again,
deeply vexed].
HIGGINS. But we want to find her.
PICKERING. We can't let her go like this, you know, Mrs. Higgins.
What were we to do?
MRS. HIGGINS. You have no more sense, either of you, than two
children. Why--
The parlor-maid comes in and breaks off the conversation.
THE PARLOR-MAID. Mr, Henry: a gentleman wants to see you very
particular. He's been sent on from Wimpole Street.
